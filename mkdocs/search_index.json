And you can easily extend functionality even further with the use of plugins.\n\n      \n\n    \n\n    \n\n      \n\n        \nOptimised for your sanity\n\n        \nRactive.js works for you, not the other way around. You do not need to learn new terminologies, concepts, and methodologies. And it plays well with libraries you already know and like to use.\n\n      \n\n    \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n    \n\n      \n\n        \nAbout Ractive.js\n\n        \nRactive was originally created at The Guardian \ntheguardian.com\n to produce news applications. A typical news app is heavily interactive, combines HTML and SVG, and is developed under extreme deadline pressure. It has to work reliably across browsers, and perform well even on mobile devices.\n\n        \nUnlike other frameworks, \nRactive works for you\n, not the other way around. It doesn't have an opinion about the other tools you want to use with it. It also adapts to the approach you want to take. You're not locked-in to a framework-specific way of thinking. Should you hate one of your tools for some reason, you can easily swap it out for another and move on with life.\n\n        \nThis project is the brainchild of an Englishman and has contributors from all over the world. There is an eclectic mix of primarily the Queen's English, a fair amount of 'Murican English, and a bit of others here and there. Things like \"adaptor\", \"behaviour\", and \"dependant\" may have more than one spelling but we try to stick to the Queen's English to the extent that we are able.\n\n        \nFun fact: Fun fact: The name is a reference to Neal Stephenson's \nThe Diamond Age: Or, A Young Lady's Illustrated Primer\n \u2013 a book about (among other things) the future of storytelling.\n\n      \n\n    \n\n    \n\n      \n\n        \nDownloads\n\n\n# jsDelivr\nhttps://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/ractive\n\n# CDNjs\nhttps://cdnjs.com/libraries/ractive\n\n# unpkg\nhttps://unpkg.com/ractive\n\n# npm\nnpm install --save-dev ractive\n\n# Bower\nbower install --save ractive",

If no matching property is found, then the reference will resolve to the current context. Once a reference is resolved, its keypath is fixed.\n\n\nIf you ever need to \nforce\n a reference to resolve in the current context, rather than potentially somewhere up the context stack, you can simply prefix the reference with a \n.\n. \n.stats.area\n will \nalways\n resolve to \ncountry.capital.stats.area\n in \n{{#with country.capital}}{{.stats.area}}{{/with}}\n, even if there is not already a \nstats\n property on \ncountry.capital\n and there is one on \ncountry\n.

But numbers are generally a hell of a lot easier to work with.\n\n\nInstead, we can use an \nexpression\n. Expressions look just like regular mustaches:\n\n\n{{ format(population) }}\n\n\n\n\nAdd a \nformat\n property alongside the country data (it may seem weird adding a function as 'data', but it will make sense in due course!):\n\n\nfunction ( num ) {\n  if ( num \n 1000000000 ) return ( num / 1000000000 ).toFixed( 1 ) + ' billion';\n  if ( num \n 1000000 ) return ( num / 1000000 ).toFixed( 1 ) + ' million';\n  if ( num \n 1000 ) return ( Math.floor( num / 1000 ) ) + ',' + ( num % 1000 );\n  return num;\n}\n\n\n\n\nExecute the code.

Let's rummage around in the bag of contrived examples and see what comes out... yep... this one will do... it's a shopping basket.\n\n\nWe have an \nitem\n property, a \nprice\n, and a \nquantity\n. Add an expression where the total should go:\n\n\ntd\n{{ price * quantity }}\n/td\n\n\n\n\n\nExecute the code. The total should appear. Now we just need to add a currency formatter \u2013 here's one for the UK (if you're not from here, write one for your own currency for extra credit):\n\n\nfunction ( num ) {\n  if ( num \n 1 ) return ( 100 * num ) + 'p';\n  return '\u00a3' + num.toFixed( 2 );\n}\n\n\n\n\nAdd that, and use in the template it for both the price and the total. Try changing the price and the quantity.\n\n\n\n\n\nractive.set({\n  item: 'banana',\n  price: 0.19,\n  quantity: 7\n});\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might reasonably ask how this works. What happens is this: when the template is parsed, any \nreferences\n inside expressions (such as \nprice\n, \nquantity\n or \nformat\n in the example above) are identified. At render time, the expression binds to those references and creates a function to calculate the result. (Whenever possible, Ractive.js will re-use functions \u2013 for example \n{{a+b}}\n and \n{{c+d}}\n would share the same function.)\n\n\nWhen the value of one or more of those references change, the expression is re-evaluated. If the result changes, the DOM is updated.\n\n\n\n\nStep 3\n\n\n\n  \nStart\n\n  \nFix Code\n\n\n\n\nIn this next contrived example, we're going to make a colour mixer.\n\n\nFirst, we want to show how much we're using of each colour. We'll use \ndiv\n elements with a percentage width corresponding to the amount. All the colour values are between 0 and 1, so we need to multiply by 100:\n\n\ndiv style='background-color: red;\n     width: {{red*100}}%;'\n/div\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate the first three \ndiv\n elements in the template accordingly.\n\n\n\n\nPro-tip: in the playground editors, hold the \nCmd\n key (or \nCtrl\n if you're not on a Mac) and click in each of the places where you need to type 100. Multiple cursors FTW!\n\n\n\n\nTo show the result, we can use an \nrgb(r,g,b)\n CSS colour value. But instead of percentages, these need to be between 0 and 255:\n\n\ndiv style='background-color:\n  rgb({{red   * 255}},\n      {{green * 255}},\n      {{blue  * 255}})'\n\n\n/div\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate the template and execute the code. Did it work?\n\n\nNo, it didn't. That's because CSS insists that you use integers \u2013 no decimals allowed. So let's use \nMath.round\n to turn the numbers into integers:\n\n\ndiv style='background-color:\n  rgb({{Math.round(red   * 255)}},\n      {{Math.round(green * 255)}},\n      {{Math.round(blue  * 255)}})'\n\n\n/div\n\n\n\n\n\nExecute the code. Ta-da! Try changing the colours.\n\n\n\n\n\nractive.set( 'red', 1 );\n// PSST!

Since \n@this\n is a \nvery\n common reference, it also has an ever so slightly shorter shorthand \n@\n. \n@this.toggle('visible')\n and \n@.toggle('visible')\n are equivalent.\n\n\n\n\nGiven that there is a \nsubtract\n method in the Ractive.js API, can you add a decrement button to the example as well?\n\n\nStep 3\n\n\n\n  \nStart\n\n  \nFix Code\n\n\n\n\nTo further wangle our incrementer contrivance, suppose we devised a web version of the old traveling game wherein you collect all of the cows that you pass on your side of the car. So we'll need two objects, one for \nme\n and one for my \nsibling\n. Each person will have a property, \ncows\n, which is an integer representing accumulated bovine beasts.\n\n\n{\n  me: { cows: 0 },\n  sibling: { cows: 0 }\n}\n\n\n\n\nThe template for this game will include a \ntable\n containing counts for each person and buttons to increment each person's taurine total.\n\n\ntable\n\n  \ntr\n\n    \nth\nMe\n/th\nth\nSibling\n/th\n\n  \n/tr\n\n  \ntr\n\n    \ntd\n\n      {{#with me}}\n        {{.cows}}\n        \nbutton\n+\n/button\n\n      {{/with}}\n    \n/td\n\n    \ntd\n\n      {{#with sibling}}\n        {{.cows}}\n        \nbutton\n+\n/button\n\n      {{/with}}\n    \n/td\n\n  \n/tr\n\n\n/table\n\n\n\n\n\nThe event listeners \ncould\n use the full path to the appropriate \ncows\n property, which is not too large an imposition here, but with a deeper context, it would quickly become inconvenient. They could also do some keypath manipulation using the special reference \n@keypath\n, which resolves to the keypath to the current context at any point in the template. That's a bit painful in most contexts and impossible in others. To address this particular issue, Ractive.js provides a special \n@context\n reference that acts as an API adaptor that is rooted in the current context of the template. \n@context\n objects have most of the same API methods as a Ractive.js instance, but they can resolve relative keypaths. Add this event directive to each of the buttons to see it in action:\n\n\nbutton on-click=\n@context.add( '.cows' )\n+\n/button\n\n\n\n\n\nTo complete the rules of the game, when you pass a cemetery on your side of the car, you lose all of your cows. It's a weird game, I know, but I didn't make it up. What would be the easiest way to reset a person's cow count?\n\n\nStep 4\n\n\n\n  \nStart\n\n\n\n\nSuppose you need to track the mouse cursor as it moves across a \ndiv\n for... reasons. Perhaps you've landed the contract for the frontend of a missile targeting system. Ractive.js provides access to the DOM event object in event directive expressions as the special \n@event\n reference. Any properties and methods available on the event object passed to the \naddEventListener\n callback are available from the \n@event\n reference e.g. \n@event.clientX\n.\n\n\ndiv id=\ntracker\n on-mousemove=\n@.set({ x: @event.clientX, y: @event.clientY })\n on-click=\nconsole.log(`firing at (${@event.clientX}, ${@event.clientY})!`)\n\n  ({{x}}, {{y}})\n\n/div\n\n\n\n\n\nThe element on which the event directive is installed is also available within event directive expressions as the special \n@node\n reference. Like the \n@event\n reference, you can access any properties or methods of the DOM element or even pass it as an argument to another function using \n@node\n.\n\n\ninput value=\nexample\n on-focus=\n@node.select()\n /\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you need to cancel an event by calling \nstopPropagation\n, you can simply make \nfalse\n the last expression in your event directive expression list.\n\n\na href=\"/nope\" on-click=\"doSomething(), false\"\nThis will do something rather than /nope.\n/a\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 5\n\n\n\n  \nStart\n\n  \nFix Code\n\n\n\n\nRactive.js also provides its own instance-level event system, so that you can raise and respond to internal events in a more abstract way. You can name your events however you like, so you can convey more meaning about the intent of the action that triggered the event, such as \naddUser\n as opposed to \nclick\n.\n\n\nTo listen to an event, you attach an event listener to your Ractive.js instance with the \non\n method.\n\n\nractive.on( 'activate', function ( context ) {\n  // `this` is the ractive instance\n  // `context` is a context object\n  // any additional event arguments would follow `context`, if supplied\n  alert( 'Activating!' );\n});\n\n\n\n\nTo raise an event, you pass the event name and optional context and arguments to the \nfire\n method.\n\n\n// this will trigger the \nractive.fire( 'activate' );\n\n\n\n\nUpdate the template and JavaScript to fire and handle an instance event, then execute. Remember, you can access the current Ractive.js instance with the \n@this\n special reference or \n@\n shorthand.\n\n\n\n\nA Ractive.js instance doesn't need to be rendered to update data or fire and handle events.\n\n\n\n\nStep 6\n\n\n\n  \nStart\n\n  \nFix Code\n\n\n\n\nYou can subscribe to multiple instance events in one go:\n\n\nractive.on({\n  activate: function () {\n    alert( 'Activating!' );\n  },\n  deactivate: function () {\n    alert( 'Deactivating!' );\n  }\n});\n\n\n\n\nAdd a 'deactivate' button and wire it up.\n\n\nStep 7\n\n\n\n  \nStart\n\n\n\n\nConverting a DOM event into an instance event is a terribly convenient way to handle user actions in a meaningful way. The signature of the \nfire\n method is a little cumbersome to include all over your template, especially if you need to pass the \n@context\n and a few additional arguments. To address that, Ractive.js provides a convenient shorthand method for firing and instance event from an event directive. If there is only one expression in the event directive arguments, that expression returns an array, and that array has a string as the first member, the event directive will fire an internal event with the first array element as the name, the current \n@context\n as the context, and any remaining members of the array as event arguments. This is generally referred to as a \"proxy event\".\n\n\nbutton on-click=\n['activate', user]\nActivate!\n/button\n\n\n!-- which is a bit more convenient than --\n\n\nbutton on-click=\n@this.fire('activate', @context, user)\nActivate!\n/button\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepending on your editor and personal tastes, it might be convenient to use an unquoted attribute for your proxied events: \nbutton on-click=['activate', user]\nActivate!\n/button\n. There is nothing special going on there - Ractive.js supports just about everything that HTML does, and HTML supports unquoted attributes e.g. \ninput value=green /\n.\n\n\n\n\nAs with regular event expressions, if a handler for a proxied event returns \nfalse\n, it will cancel the event.\n\n\nStep 8\n\n\n\n  \nStart\n\n  \nFix Code\n\n\n\n\nThere are a couple of ways to unsubscribe from events. If you've used jQuery, you'll be used to this syntax:\n\n\nractive.on( 'select', selectHandler );\n\n// later...\nractive.off( 'select', selectHandler );\n\n\n\n\nThat's fine, as long as you stored a reference to selectHandler (i.e. you didn't just use an anonymous function). If you didn't, you can also do this:\n\n\n// remove ALL 'select' handlers\nractive.off( 'select' );\n\n// remove all handlers of ANY type\nractive.off();\n\n\n\n\nAlternatively, you can do this:\n\n\nvar listener = ractive.on( 'select', selectHandler );\n\nvar otherListeners = ractive.on({\n  activate: function () { alert( 'Activating' ); },\n  deactivate: function () { alert( 'Deactivating!' ); }\n});\n\n// later...\nlistener.cancel();\notherListeners.cancel();\n\n\n\n\nTry adding a 'stop' button which removes the 'activate' and 'deactivate' handlers.\n\n\nYou can also temporarily disable an event handler or set of event handlers by calling \nsilence\n on the handle returned by \non\n. You can resume processing of the handler or handlers by calling the conveniently named \nresume\n method on the handle.\n\n\nvar listener = ractive.on({\n  'select', function () { alert( 'Selected!' ); },\n  'delete', function () { alert( 'Deleted!' ); }\n});\n\n// later...\nlistener.silence();\n\n// no alerts here\nractive.fire( 'select' );\nractive.fire( 'delete' );\n\n// later...\nlistener.resume();\n\n// alert here\nractive.fire( 'select' );\n\n\n\n\nTry adding a silence button that checks to see if the listener is silenced using the handle's \nisSilenced\n method, and silences or resumes it as appropriate.\n\n\n\n\nIf you remove your ractive from the DOM with \nractive.teardown()\n, any event handlers will be automatically cleaned up.\n\n\n\n\nStep 9\n\n\n\n  \nStart\n\n  \nFix Code\n\n\n\n\nIt's possible to define custom template events in Ractive.js. You use them just like normal events:\n\n\nbutton on-tap='activate'\nActivate!\n/button\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that we're using on-tap here instead of \non-click\n \u2013 \ntap\n is a custom event.\n\n\n\n\nCustom events are distributed as plugins, which can be downloaded from here to include in your project.\n\n\nYou can also create your own plugins \u2013 just follow the instructions on the docs.\n\n\n\n\nThe trouble with \nclick\n is that it's nonsense. If you put your mouse down on the 'activate' button, waggle it about, then lift your finger up after a few seconds, the browser will in most cases consider it a 'click'. I don't. Do you?\n\n\nFurthermore, if your interface needs to work on touch devices, using \nclick\n means a 300ms delay between the \ntouchstart\n-\ntouchend\n sequence event and the simulated \nmousedown\n-\nmouseup\n-\nclick\n sequence.\n\n\nThe tap event corrects for both of these anomalies. Try replacing the click proxies in the template.",

The signature of the  fire  method is a little cumbersome to include all over your template, especially if you need to pass the  @context  and a few additional arguments. To address that, Ractive.js provides a convenient shorthand method for firing and instance event from an event directive. If there is only one expression in the event directive arguments, that expression returns an array, and that array has a string as the first member, the event directive will fire an internal event with the first array element as the name, the current  @context  as the context, and any remaining members of the array as event arguments.

There is nothing special going on there - Ractive.js supports just about everything that HTML does, and HTML supports unquoted attributes e.g.  input value=green / .

Whichever you prefer:\nractive.set( 'superheroes.3.power', 'Enhanced senses' );\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat if there weren't any items in the array? Displaying a table with no rows has been recognized by the International Web Decorum Foundation as impolite, so Ractive.js will allow you to provide alternate content using an \n{{else}}\n section in the \n#each\n block, which will be rendered if the array is empty.\n\n\n{{#each superheroes}}\n  \ntr\n...\n/tr\n\n{{else}}\n  \ntr\ntd colspan=\"4\"\nOh no!

Let's add a number column to our table \u2013 first add the column to the header row:\n\n\ntr\n\n  \nth\n#\n/th\n\n  \nth\nSuperhero name\n/th\n\n  \n!-- etc --\n\n\n/tr\n\n\n\n\n\nThen to the list row:\n\n\n{{#each superheroes: num}}\n  \ntr\n\n    \ntd\n{{num}}\n/td\n\n    \ntd\na href='{{info}}'\n{{name}}\n/a\n/td\n\n    \ntd\n{{realname}}\n/td\n\n    \ntd\n{{power}}\n/td\n\n  \n/tr\n\n{{/each}}\n\n\n\n\nExecute the code.\n\n\nNot bad, but it would look better if the numbers started at 1 rather than 0. Use an expression to increment each row number by 1.\n\n\nStep 3\n\n\n\n  \nStart\n\n\n\n\nLet's say you wanted to add an item to your list. You could use \nractive.set()\n the way you're used to, but you'd have to find the length of the existing array first:\n\n\nvar index = ractive.get( 'superheroes' ).length;\nractive.set( 'superheroes[' + index + ']', newSuperhero );\n\n\n\n\nThat's not ideal. We could use \nractive.update('superheroes')\n instead, which will make sure that the table is up to date:\n\n\nxmen[ xmen.length ] = newSuperhero;\nractive.update( 'superheroes' );\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you don't pass a keypath argument to \nractive.update()\n, Ractive.js will update everything that has changed since the last set or update.\n\n\n\n\nBut there's a more convenient way. Ractive.js provides mutator methods for arrays (push, pop, shift, unshift, splice, sort and reverse) that work with a keypath:\n\n\nractive.push( 'superheroes', newSuperhero );\n\n\n\n\nTry adding Storm to the list by pushing to the array in the Script pane:\n\n\nvar newSuperhero = {\n  name: 'Storm',\n  realname: 'Monroe, Ororo',\n  power: 'Controlling the weather',\n  info: 'http://www.superherodb.com/Storm/10-135/'\n};\n\n// add the code here...\n\n\n\n\nStep 4\n\n\n\n  \nStart\n\n  \nFix Code\n\n\n\n\nIt's time to make our table sortable. We've added a 'sortable' class to the three headers to indicate they can be clicked on.\n\n\nFirst, let's add an event listener to each column header, calling the instance \nsort\n method with the column header as an argument:\n\n\nth class='sortable' on-click='@.sort(\nname\n)'\nSuperhero name\n/th\n\n\nth class='sortable' on-click='@.sort(\nrealname\n)'\nReal name\n/th\n\n\nth class='sortable' on-click='@.sort(\npower\n)'\nSuperpower\n/th\n\n\n\n\n\nThat way, when the user clicks one of the column headers, the view will fire call the \nsort\n method.\n\n\nractive.sort = function ( column ) {\n  alert( 'Sorting by ' + column );\n});\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can add methods and properties directly to a Ractive.js instance by simply including them in the init options. Any keys that don't match know init options are added to the instance upon creation.\n\n\n\n\nExecute the code. When you click on the three sortable headers, the browser should alert the name of the column we're sorting by. Now we just need to add the sorting logic.\n\n\nStep 5\n\n\n\n  \nStart\n\n  \nFix Code\n\n\n\n\nSo we've wired up our event handler, and it's behaving as it should. The next step is to add some logic that actually sorts the table. For bonus points, we'll add a 'sorted' class to the header of the sorted column.\n\n\nThere's a nice easy way to ensure that the table remains sorted, even when we add more data: an expression. That's right, you can use expressions with sections.\n\n\nUpdate the template:\n\n\n{{#each sort( superheroes ) : num}}\n  \ntr\n\n   \n!-- row contents --\n\n  \n/tr\n\n{{/each}}\n\n\n\n\nNow we need to add the \nsort\n function. Here's one (if you're not sure why this works, \nhere's an MDN page\n that will help explain):\n\n\nfunction ( array ) {\n  // grab the current sort column\n  var column = this.get( 'sortColumn' ); \n\n  // clone the array so as not to modify the underlying data\n  var arr = array.slice();\n\n  return arr.sort( function ( a, b ) {\n    return a[ sortColumn ] \n b[ sortColumn ] ? -1 : 1;\n  });\n}\n\n\n\n\nWiring it up is easy:\n\n\nractive.sort = function ( column ) {\n  this.set( 'sortColumn', column );\n});\n\n\n\n\nTry executing this code and clicking different headers to sort the table. (You could specify an initial sort column by adding e.g. \nsortColumn: 'name'\n to \ndata\n.)\n\n\nThe last job is to add a sorted class to the header of the currently sorted column. There are several ways we could do this \u2013 you could use a bit of jQuery inside the sort proxy event handler, for example. But for this demonstration we'll put the logic in the template, using the conditional operator:\n\n\nth class='sortable' class-sorted=\nsortColumn === 'name'\n on-click='@.sort(\nname\n)'\n\n  Superhero name\n\n/th\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nclass-\n directive is similar to the \nstyle-\n directive - it gives you direct control over the presence of a single class. The \nclass-\n directive exists in an expression context, so mustaches are not required. If the expression passed to the directive is truthy, Ractive.js will add the class to the element, and if it's false-y, it will remove it.\n\n\nYou could also add an additional expression within the existing \nclass\n attribute using a ternary e.g. \nclass=\"sortable {{ sortColumn === 'name' ? 'sorted' : '' }}\n.\n\n\n\n\nDo this for each of the headers, then execute the code. Congratulations! You've built a sortable table in just a few steps. Now comes the fun part \u2013 add Storm back to the table. The table will maintain its sort order.\n\n\nractive.push( 'superheroes', {\n  name: 'Storm',\n  realname: 'Monroe, Ororo',\n  power: 'Controlling the weather',\n  info: 'http://www.superherodb.com/Storm/10-135/'\n});",

            "text": "Start \n   Fix Code   So we've wired up our event handler, and it's behaving as it should. The next step is to add some logic that actually sorts the table. For bonus points, we'll add a 'sorted' class to the header of the sorted column.  There's a nice easy way to ensure that the table remains sorted, even when we add more data: an expression. That's right, you can use expressions with sections.  Update the template:  {{#each sort( superheroes ) : num}}\n   tr \n    !-- row contents -- \n   /tr \n{{/each}}  Now we need to add the  sort  function. Here's one (if you're not sure why this works,  here's an MDN page  that will help explain):  function ( array ) {\n  // grab the current sort column\n  var column = this.get( 'sortColumn' ); \n\n  // clone the array so as not to modify the underlying data\n  var arr = array.slice();\n\n  return arr.sort( function ( a, b ) {\n    return a[ sortColumn ]   b[ sortColumn ] ? -1 : 1;\n  });\n}  Wiring it up is easy:  ractive.sort = function ( column ) {\n  this.set( 'sortColumn', column );\n});  Try executing this code and clicking different headers to sort the table. (You could specify an initial sort column by adding e.g.  sortColumn: 'name'  to  data .)  The last job is to add a sorted class to the header of the currently sorted column. There are several ways we could do this \u2013 you could use a bit of jQuery inside the sort proxy event handler, for example. But for this demonstration we'll put the logic in the template, using the conditional operator:  th class='sortable' class-sorted= sortColumn === 'name'  on-click='@.sort( name )' \n  Superhero name /th    The  class-  directive is similar to the  style-  directive - it gives you direct control over the presence of a single class. The  class-  directive exists in an expression context, so mustaches are not required. If the expression passed to the directive is truthy, Ractive.js will add the class to the element, and if it's false-y, it will remove it.  You could also add an additional expression within the existing  class  attribute using a ternary e.g.  class=\"sortable {{ sortColumn === 'name' ? 'sorted' : '' }} .   Do this for each of the headers, then execute the code. Congratulations! You've built a sortable table in just a few steps. Now comes the fun part \u2013 add Storm back to the table. The table will maintain its sort order.  ractive.push( 'superheroes', {\n  name: 'Storm',\n  realname: 'Monroe, Ororo',\n  power: 'Controlling the weather',\n  info: 'http://www.superherodb.com/Storm/10-135/'\n});",

            "text": "Two-way Binding\n\n\nHTML forms are a very important part of many web applications. Most data-binding in a template only goes in one direction - from the model to the view, but form elements provide a point at which the view could update the model. To that end, Ractive.js provides special bindings for form elements that go both ways - from the model to the view and from the view to the model - or two-way bindings.\n\n\nStep 1\n\n\n\n  \nStart\n\n  \nFix Code\n\n\n\n\nThe 'Hello, world!' of two-way data binding looks like this:\n\n\nlabel\n\n  Enter your name:\n  \ninput value='{{name}}'\n\n\n/label\n\n\n\np\nHello, {{name}}!\n/p\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate the template and re-render it, then type your name in the box.\n\n\n\n\nInternally, we're binding to \ninput\n events (and \nkeyup\n for IE, since it doesn't fire \ninput\n correctly) alongside \nchange\n and \nblur\n events \u2013 this ensures instantaneous feedback for a slick experience.\n\n\nIf you'd rather the updates only happened on \nchange\n and \nblur\n, pass in \nlazy: true\n as an initialisation option.\n\n\nIf you'd rather disable two-way binding altogether, you can do so with \ntwoway: false\n.\n\n\nYou can also control two-way bindings and laziness on a per-element basis using the \ntwoway\n and \nlazy\n directives. The \nlazy\n directive may be boolean, or if you'd like to get updates without a blur, you can pass it a number of milliseconds to wait after the last \ninput\n event to trigger the update.\n\n\n\n\nThat's a cute demo, but it doesn't have much real world use. In all likelihood we want to do something with the data when it changes. For that, we use \nractive.observe()\n:\n\n\nractive.observe( 'name', function ( newValue, oldValue ) {\n  doSomethingWith( newValue );\n});\n\n\n\n\nStep 2\n\n\n\n  \nStart\n\n  \nFix Code\n\n\n\n\nYou can control whether checkboxes are checked or not like so:\n\n\nlabel\n\n  \ninput type='checkbox' checked='{{checked}}'\n\n  {{#if checked}}checked!{{else}}not checked{{/if}}\n\n/label\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate the template and try toggling the checkbox.\n\n\nIf you have a group of radio buttons, whose values are mutually exclusive, you can do this:\n\n\nlabel\ninput type='radio' name='{{color}}' value='red' checked\n red\n/label\n\n\nlabel\ninput type='radio' name='{{color}}' value='green'\n green\n/label\n\n\nlabel\ninput type='radio' name='{{color}}' value='blue'\n blue\n/label\n\n\np\nThe selected colour is \nspan style='color: {{color}};'\n{{color}}\n/span\n.\n/p\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, because we've set the \nname\n attribute to \n{{color}}\n, the value of \ncolor\n is set to the \nvalue\n attribute of whichever radio button is currently checked. (If you need to read that sentence a couple of times, I don't blame you.) Notice that the value is initialised to \nred\n, because that option is initially checked.\n\n\nAdd \nname='{{color}}'\n to each of the options in the template and run the code.\n\n\n\n\nFront-end \u00fcber nerds will notice that this isn't how these attributes normally work. For example, a checkbox with checked='false' is the same as one with checked='true', because it's a boolean attribute which either exists on the element or doesn't \u2013 its value is completely irrelevant.\n\n\nFurthermore, once you've interacted with a checkbox, its checked attribute becomes irrelevant! You can only change the value programmatically by doing element.checked = true rather than  element.setAttribute( 'checked' ).\n\n\nCombine all that with cross-browser quirks (e.g. IE8 and below only fire  change events on blur), and we're in some seriously confusing territory.\n\n\nSo Ractive.js makes no apology for using checked='{{checked}}' to mean 'checked if checked is true, unchecked if it's false'. We're bringing sanity to the process of gathering user input.\n\n\n\n\nNeedless to say, you can continue to interact with the values programmatically:\n\n\nractive.set( 'checked', true );\nractive.set( 'color', 'green' );\n\n\n\n\nThis is as good a time as any to introduce the \nractive.toggle()\n method:\n\n\nractive.toggle( 'checked' );\n\n// Equivalent to:\n//   var checked = ractive.get( 'checked' );\n//   ractive.set( 'checked', !checked );\n\n\n\n\nStep 3\n\n\n\n  \nStart\n\n  \nFix Code\n\n\n\n\nAs well as \ninput\n elements (and \ntextarea\ns, which work similarly), two-way binding works with \nselect\n menus. Let's replace the radio group from the previous step with a \nselect\n:\n\n\nselect value='{{color}}'\n\n  \noption\nred\n/option\n\n  \noption\ngreen\n/option\n\n  \noption selected\nblue\n/option\n\n\n/select\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI apologise to my fellow Brits, and other English-speaking non-Americans, for the repeated use of color instead of colour. Occupational hazard.\n\n\n\n\nRe-render the ractive. Notice that once again, the data is initialised to the value of the selected \noption\n \u2013 in this case, blue. (You can explicity set a \nvalue\n attribute, but if you don't, the text content of the \noption\n is used instead.)\n\n\nThat's good, but we can go one better \u2013 rather than hard-coding our colours into the template, let's do it properly:\n\n\nselect value='{{color}}'\n\n  {{#each colors}}\n    \noption\n{{this}}\n/option\n\n  {{/each}}\n\n/select\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe haven't seen \n{{this}}\n before \u2013 it simply means 'the current context'. Previously, whenever we've used lists, they've been lists of objects, so we've been able to use a property of the object (like \n{{name}}\n). Using this allows us to use lists of primitives (in this case, strings) instead.\n\n\nIf you prefer, you can use \n{{.}}\n instead of \n{{this}}\n.\n\n\nYou can also set up an alias to \nthis\n for a slightly more human friendly template in many circumstances. Within \n{{#each users as user}}...{{/each}}\n, \nuser\n will resolve to the current iteration. You can still use index names too e.g. \n{{#each users as user: i}}...{{/each}}\n.\n\n\n\n\nAnd add some data to our view:\n\n\nvar ractive = Ractive({\n  el: output,\n  template: template,\n  data: {\n    colors: [ 'red', 'green', 'blue' ],\n    color: 'green'\n  }\n});\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe template no longer has an \noption\n with a \nselected\n attribute, so we need to specify an initial value of \ncolor\n.\nExecute this code. For extra credit, add more colours:\n\n\n\n\nractive.push( 'colors', 'purple' );\n\n\n\n\nStep 4\n\n\n\n  \nStart\n\n  \nFix Code\n\n\n\n\nIn some situations you need to make it possible to select several values simultaneously. HTML has us covered \u2013 we use the \nmultiple\n attribute with a \nselect\n.\n\n\nUnfortunately that's as helpful as it gets \u2013 \nselectElement.value\n returns the value of the \nmost recently selected\n option, which is just mad, frankly.

It's not too bad, but the template would look neater if we could separate out the code for an individual item. Well, we can. Add this above the rest of the JavaScript:\n\n\nvar item = \nli class-done='.done'\n +\n           \n   \ninput type='checkbox' checked='{{.done}}'\n +\n           \n   \nspan class='description' on-click=\\\nedit\\\n +\n           \n   {{.description}}\n +\n           \n   {{#if .editing}}\n +\n           \n     \ninput class='edit'\n +\n           \n              value='{{.description}}'\n +\n           \n              on-blur='@context.toggle( \\\n.editing\\\n ), false'\n +\n           \n              on-keydown=\\\n@.enterExit( @event, @context )\\\n +\n           \n   {{/if}}\n +\n           \n   \n/span\n +\n           \n   \nbutton class='button' on-click='@context.splice( \\\n../\\\n, @index, 1 )'\n\u00d7\n/button\n +\n           \n \n/li\n;\n\n\n\n\nThen, in the main template we replace all that with a partial, which looks like a regular mustache but with a \n character:\n\n\nul class='todos'\n\n  {{#each items: i}}\n    {{\nitem}}\n  {{/each}}\n\n/ul\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, we need to add the partial when we initialize out instance:\n\n\nvar ractive = Ractive({\n  target: '#target',\n  template: '#template',\n\n  partials: { item: item },\n  // etc...\n});\n\n\n\n\nExecute this code.\n\n\nStep 2\n\n\n\n  \nStart\n\n  \nFix Code\n\n\n\n\nFine, except that multiline string was fugly. It's good to know that you can pass partials in as strings, but unless you're loading those strings from a template file with AJAX, you'd probably prefer a neater way.\n\n\nThere are two. Firstly, you can add partials as \nscript\n tags on the page:\n\n\nscript id=\nitem\n type=\ntext/html\n\n  \nli class-done='.done'\n\n    \ninput type='checkbox' checked='{{.done}}'\n\n    \nspan class='description' on-click=\nedit\n\n      {{.description}}\n\n      {{#if .editing}}\n        \ninput class='edit'\n               value='{{.description}}'\n               on-blur='@context.toggle( \n.editing\n ), false'\n               on-keydown=\n@.enterExit( @event, @context )\n\n      {{/if}}\n    \n/span\n\n    \nbutton class='button' on-click='@context.splice( \n../\n, @index, 1 )'\n\u00d7\n/button\n\n  \n/li\n\n\n/script\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that the \nid\n attribute is the name of the partial, and that the \ntype\n attribute is \ntext/html\n (though it could be anything, as long as it's not \ntext/javascript\n). This is a convenient way to quickly test ideas out on a blank page (you can use these script tags as main templates as well as partials - just reference them as e.g. \n'#myTemplate'\n in your initialisation options).\n\n\n\n\nOr, you can use an \ninline partial\n. Inline partials are declared within your template, using the \n{{#partial myPartialName}}\n syntax:\n\n\n{{#partial item}}\n  \nli class-done='.done'\n\n    \ninput type='checkbox' checked='{{.done}}'\n\n    \nspan class='description' on-click=\nedit\n\n      {{.description}}\n\n      {{#if .editing}}\n        \ninput class='edit'\n               value='{{.description}}'\n               on-blur='@context.toggle( \n.editing\n ), false'\n               on-keydown=\n@.enterExit( @event, @context )\n\n      {{/if}}\n    \n/span\n\n    \nbutton class='button' on-click='@context.splice( \n../\n, @index, 1 )'\n\u00d7\n/button\n\n  \n/li\n\n{{/partial}}\n\n\n\n\nAdd the partial to the template, and remove it (and the \nvar item = ...\n bit) from the javascript code.\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to supporting partial strings, Ractive.js will accept a pre-parsed template in the \npartials\n map, or as the \ntemplate\n option, for that matter. Pre-parsed partials have the benefit of not requiring the parser at runtime, which means rendering can happen a bit faster - and you can ship a lighter-weight version of Ractive.js to the browser (see the runtime-only build).\n\n\n\n\nStep 3\n\n\n\n  \nStart\n\n  \nFix Code\n\n\n\n\nThat covers breaking templates into more manageable or logical chunks, so moving on to reuse, we'll grab our handy bag of contrivances and pull out... a formatted name. It's a bit simple, but it should suffice.\n\n\nSuppose we have a webapp that deals with people, businesses, and the yachts that they own. All three of those happen to have names that we'll say are broken down in slightly different ways. A yacht just has a name. A business has a name and a potential classifier, like LLC. A person has a given name, a family name, any number of middle names, and a potential suffix. A yacht is also owned by a business or a person, which, as we've established, both have names. (We're gonna go ahead and pretend that most yacht owners don't have a corporate entity to hold their yachts.)\n\n\nWhat we want to do is take our list of yachts with their various owners and display them in the table. Here's a partial that would work with each type of entity:\n\n\n{{#if .type === 'business'}}\n  {{.name}}{{.classifier ? `, ${.classifier}` : ''}}\n{{elseif .type === 'yacht'}}\n  {{name}}\n{{else}}\n  {{.familyName}}, {{.givenName}}{{.suffix ? ` ${.suffix}` : ''}}\n{{/if}}\n\n\n\n\nNow we want to use the partial for both the yacht and the owner, but the owner is a property of the yacht. We could use a \n#with\n block to set the context for the owner partial. It turns out that's a pretty common thing to need when working with complex apps with lots of partials, so Ractive.js has a sugared version of a partial that accepts a context after the partial name:\n\n\n{{\nname .owner}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is roughly equivalent to \n{{#with .owner}}{{\nname}}{{/with}}\n, but not quite exactly the same. For reasons that will become clear in the next step, the \n#with\n portion of the partial with context is wrapped around the template of the partial and not the partial mustache itself.\n\n\nIf no context is supplied to a partial, then it inherits its context from its parent.\n\n\nPartials may also set aliases instead of passing a context, which is convenient if there's more than one bit of data that needs to be uniform going into the partial. For instance \n{{\nuser .homePhone as phone, .workEmail as email}}\n lets the caller of the partial specify what \n{{phone}}\n and \n{{email}}\n should mean inside the partial.

It's good to know that you can pass partials in as strings, but unless you're loading those strings from a template file with AJAX, you'd probably prefer a neater way.  There are two. Firstly, you can add partials as  script  tags on the page:  script id= item  type= text/html \n   li class-done='.done' \n     input type='checkbox' checked='{{.done}}' \n     span class='description' on-click= edit \n      {{.description}}\n\n      {{#if .editing}}\n         input class='edit'\n               value='{{.description}}'\n               on-blur='@context.toggle(  .editing  ), false'\n               on-keydown= @.enterExit( @event, @context ) \n      {{/if}}\n     /span \n     button class='button' on-click='@context.splice(  ../ , @index, 1 )' \u00d7 /button \n   /li  /script    Note that the  id  attribute is the name of the partial, and that the  type  attribute is  text/html  (though it could be anything, as long as it's not  text/javascript ). This is a convenient way to quickly test ideas out on a blank page (you can use these script tags as main templates as well as partials - just reference them as e.g.  '#myTemplate'  in your initialisation options).   Or, you can use an  inline partial . Inline partials are declared within your template, using the  {{#partial myPartialName}}  syntax:  {{#partial item}}\n   li class-done='.done' \n     input type='checkbox' checked='{{.done}}' \n     span class='description' on-click= edit \n      {{.description}}\n\n      {{#if .editing}}\n         input class='edit'\n               value='{{.description}}'\n               on-blur='@context.toggle(  .editing  ), false'\n               on-keydown= @.enterExit( @event, @context ) \n      {{/if}}\n     /span \n     button class='button' on-click='@context.splice(  ../ , @index, 1 )' \u00d7 /button \n   /li \n{{/partial}}  Add the partial to the template, and remove it (and the  var item = ...  bit) from the javascript code.   In addition to supporting partial strings, Ractive.js will accept a pre-parsed template in the  partials  map, or as the  template  option, for that matter. Pre-parsed partials have the benefit of not requiring the parser at runtime, which means rendering can happen a bit faster - and you can ship a lighter-weight version of Ractive.js to the browser (see the runtime-only build).",

It's a bit simple, but it should suffice.  Suppose we have a webapp that deals with people, businesses, and the yachts that they own. All three of those happen to have names that we'll say are broken down in slightly different ways. A yacht just has a name. A business has a name and a potential classifier, like LLC. A person has a given name, a family name, any number of middle names, and a potential suffix. A yacht is also owned by a business or a person, which, as we've established, both have names. (We're gonna go ahead and pretend that most yacht owners don't have a corporate entity to hold their yachts.)  What we want to do is take our list of yachts with their various owners and display them in the table. Here's a partial that would work with each type of entity:  {{#if .type === 'business'}}\n  {{.name}}{{.classifier ? `, ${.classifier}` : ''}}\n{{elseif .type === 'yacht'}}\n  {{name}}\n{{else}}\n  {{.familyName}}, {{.givenName}}{{.suffix ? ` ${.suffix}` : ''}}\n{{/if}}  Now we want to use the partial for both the yacht and the owner, but the owner is a property of the yacht. We could use a  #with  block to set the context for the owner partial. It turns out that's a pretty common thing to need when working with complex apps with lots of partials, so Ractive.js has a sugared version of a partial that accepts a context after the partial name:  {{ name .owner}}   This is roughly equivalent to  {{#with .owner}}{{ name}}{{/with}} , but not quite exactly the same. For reasons that will become clear in the next step, the  #with  portion of the partial with context is wrapped around the template of the partial and not the partial mustache itself.  If no context is supplied to a partial, then it inherits its context from its parent.  Partials may also set aliases instead of passing a context, which is convenient if there's more than one bit of data that needs to be uniform going into the partial. For instance  {{ user .homePhone as phone, .workEmail as email}}  lets the caller of the partial specify what  {{phone}}  and  {{email}}  should mean inside the partial.

First, we need to add a mustache for the image URL:\n\n\ndiv class='main-image'\n     style='background-image: url(\n{{image.src}}\n);'\n\n\n/div\n\n\n\n\n\nWe're using a CSS background rather than an \nimg\n element for this example, because you can use the \nbackground-size: contain\n CSS rule to ensure that the image is shown at maximum size without distorting the aspect ratio.\n\n\nThen, we need to add a mustache for the image caption:\n\n\ndiv class='caption'\n\n  \np\n{{image.caption}}\n/p\n\n\n/div\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, let's add some event expressions that we can fill in later:\n\n\na class='prev' on-click='@.goto(current - 1)'\nspan\nlaquo;\n/span\n/a\n\n\n!-- ... --\n\n\na class='next' on-click='@.goto(current + 1)'\nspan\nraquo;\n/span\n/a\n\n\n\n\n\nExecute the JavaScript to redraw the view, with the placeholder data that's already there.\n\n\nStep 2\n\n\n\n  \nStart\n\n  \nFix Code\n\n\n\n\nTime to create our \nSlideshow\n class:\n\n\nvar Slideshow = Ractive.extend({\n  // this will be applied to all Slideshow instances\n  template: '#slideshow',\n\n  // method for changing the currently displayed image\n  goto: function ( imageNum ) {\n    // goto method goes here...\n  },\n\n  // default data\n  oninit: function () {\n    // return the default data for the component here\n  }\n});\n\n\n\n\nEach \nSlideshow\n instance will have a \ngoto\n method in addition to the normal \nRactive\n instance methods. We'll also provide default data for the component, notably to start with the \ncurrent\n index as \n0\n.\n\n\n\n\nWhen providing data for components, you should always use a data function that returns a data dictionary. If you return the same object from each invocation, then all of your component instances will share the same underlying data, but the properties won't necessarily be kept up-to-date across instances.\n\n\nComponent data and instance data is combined into the final instance's data dictionary starting with Ractive default data, moving through the component hierarchy, and ending with the data supplied to the instance constructor.\n\n\n\n\nLet's write our \ngoto\n method:\n\n\nfunction ( index ) {\n  var images = this.get( 'images' );\n\n  // handle wrap around\n  var num = ( index + images.length ) % images.length;\n\n  this.set( 'current', num );\n}\n\n\n\n\nLet's add some code to instantiate the slideshow with our gifs. There's a ready-made images variable you can use for this step:\n\n\nvar slideshow = Slideshow({\n  target: '#target',\n  data: { images: images }\n});\n\n\n\n\nGo ahead and execute the code \u2013 you should now have a working slideshow.\n\n\n\n\nNeedless to say, you could add as many bells and whistles as you wanted \u2013 fading or sliding transitions, image preloading, thumbnails, touchscreen gesture controls, and so on.\n\n\nYou could, of course, just use an existing image slideshow library. But then you would have to learn that library, and potentially submit to its design philosophy.\n\n\nRactive.js is all about flexibility. If you want to change the design or behaviour of a component (say, adding a class name to a particular element), the power to do so is in your hands \u2013 the template is easy to understand and tweak because it's basically just HTML, and the view logic is straightforward.\n\n\nIt's better to be able to build your own solution than to rely on developers maintaining high quality and up-to-date documentation.\n\n\n\n\nStep 3\n\n\n\n  \nStart\n\n  \nFix Code\n\n\n\n\nNow we have our lovely slideshow component, but suppose we want to use it in our Ractive.js app rather than mounting it directly on an element. It turns out that that is a pretty simple thing to accomplish. We can register our component with either globally or with our main Ractive.js instance, and anywhere that the template has a \nslideshow /\n element, Ractive.js will create an instance of \nSlideshow\n and mount it inline.\n\n\nRactive.components.slideshow = Slideshow;\n\n// or\nvar ractive = Ractive({\n    // ...\n\n  components: {\n    slideshow: Slideshow\n  },\n\n  // ...\n});\n\n\n\n\nNow in the template, we just reference the component as if it were a custom element:\n\n\ndiv style-height=\n40vh\n\n  \nslideshow /\n\n\n/div\n\n\n\n\n\nWe \nwere\n passing the list of pictures to the instance as it was being initialized, but since Ractive.js is now managing the instance, how do we get the list of pictures to the component instance? Well, we create a mapping from the data in the host instance to the \nimages\n keypath in the component by using an attribute:\n\n\ndiv style-height=\n40vh\n\n  \nslideshow images=\n{{devopsImages}}\n /\n\n\n/div\n\n\n\n\n\nUpdate the code with another images array and put two \nslideshow\n components in the main instance.\n\n\n\n\nMappings are automatically managed cross-instance \nlink\ns. A link is a bit like a filesystem symlink in that the data isn't copied anywhere - it just gets a new path that points to it. Changing the data in either place is effectively the same as changing it everywhere at once.\n\n\n\n\nStep 4\n\n\n\n  \nStart\n\n  \nFix Code\n\n\n\n\nWe have our image slideshow usable from any app now, but what if we wanted to make it slightly more customizable? Perhaps we could allow the user to have a bit more control over the template by, say, letting them include some sort of disclaimer on all of the slides. We could hard-code the disclaimer in a special version for each client, but that sounds like it would be awful to maintain.\n\n\nFortunately, Ractive.js allows you to use the content of a component tag to pass partials to the component instance. Any content not within a \n{{#patial}}\n tag is collected up and exposed to the component as a partial named \ncontent\n. Any \n{{#partial}}\ns are supplied to the component instance with the names they are given in the \n{{#partial}}\n tag. We'll use a disclaimer partial for our component:\n\n\nslideshow\n\n  {{#partial disclaimer}}\ndiv class=\ndisclaimer\nI don't know what we're disclaiming, but we're disclaiming it \na on-click=\n@.disclaim(), false\n href=\n#\nhere\n/a\n.\n/div\n{{/partial}}\n\n/slideshow\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can add a reference to the partial in the \nSlideshow\n component template:\n\n\n{{\ndisclaimer}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's not a bad idea to supply a default partial with the component, so that Ractive.js doesn't emit any warnings about missing partials. Any partials passed to the component will override any supplied to \nextend\n.\n\n\n\n\nNow what will happen when you click the \"here\" link? Partials exist completely in the context of the instance in which they are used, and there is no \ndisclaim\n method on the \nSlideshow\n component, so nothing will happen (except an error will be logged to the console). If you want a passed-in partial to render in the context from which it was passed, you can \n{{yield}}\n it.\n\n\n{{yield disclaimer}}\n\n\n\n\nAdd a \ndisclaim\n method to the main instance, update the \nSlideshow\n component, and run the code to see it all in action.\n\n\n\n\nSince \nyield\n puts the partial in the context of the caller, there's not much point in using it within an \n#each\n block because the array being iterated is unreachable from the \nyield\n. \nyield\ns can also supply aliases to data local to the component e.g. \n{{yield disclaimer with current as currentImage}}\n. \nyield\ning the \ncontent\n partial just requires dropping the name.\n\n\n\n\nStep 5\n\n\n\n  \nStart\n\n  \nFix Code\n\n\n\n\nNow suppose we wanted to do something to each of our component instances as they're created, like validate that they have certain parameters provided and issue a warning if they don't. Ractive.js components actually have a pretty complete set of lifecycle events that allow component authors to hook into just about every stage of a component's lifecycle - from \nconstruct\nion to \ndestruct\nion hitting \ninit\n, \nrender\n, \nunrender\n, \nteardown\n, \ncomplete\n (\nrender\n complete along with any transitions) and a few others in between. Each lifecycle event also happens to be an instance event.\n\n\nLets add our check to make sure the \nSlideshow\n component receives an \nimage\n parameter. There are a few ways to do this, including using \non\n and providing an \noninit\n function as an initialization parameter.\n\n\nvar ractive = Ractive({\n  // ...\n  on: {\n    init: function () {}\n  },\n  // ...\n});\n\n// or\n\nvar ractive = Ractive({\n  // ...\n  oninit: function () {},\n  // ...\n});\n\n// for other lifecycle events, you can attach after init\n\nractive.on( 'render', function () {} );\n\n\n\n\nAdd an \ninit\n event handler that checks to see if there are no images and issues a warning if there are none.\n\n\nStep 6\n\n\n\n  \nStart\n\n  \nFix Code\n\n\n\n\nWhen we started out with our slideshow, we were rendering it directly to a target element rather than as a component in another Ractive.js instance. It turns out that having self-contained components like that is a pretty convenient pattern for managing complexity in a larger app. All of the related functionality for a feature or group of features can be grouped into one Ractive.js extension known as a \nview\n. Each individual view can then be loaded and/or rendered independently.\n\n\nIn order do use views with a main instance controlling the overall app, you would have to have some sort of big \n#if\n/\nelse\n block with each view included as a branch. You could also resort to some sort of partial generation scheme. There's an easier way though.\n\n\nRactive.js will allow you to attach one independent instance to another using \nattachChild\n, optionally specifying a \ntarget\n. If you don't specify a target, then the child instance will not be rendered, but if you \ndo\n specify a target, then the instance will be rendered into the first available matching \nanchor\n. An anchor looks like a component or element, but its name always starts with a \n#\n. You may have as many anchors as you like, and they may each have the same or different names.\n\n\n#anchor /\n\n\n#ICallThisOneStan\n\n  Stan has a content partial.\n  {{#partial name}}He also has a name partial.{{/partial}}\n\n/ICallThisOneStan\n\n\n\n\n\nGo ahead and fill out the two provided views as you like, add anchors to the main instance template, and attach an instance of each view to an anchor on the main instance.\n\n\n\n\nYou can detach a child using the conveniently named \ndetachChild\n method.\n\n\nChild instances can be attached in \nprepend\n, \ninsertAt\n, or \nappend\n (the default) mode. Ractive.js will try to find a matching anchor for each child starting with the first. If there aren't enough anchors, some instances will not be rendered. Each time a child is attached or detached, Ractive.js will adjust any affected anchors so all instances that can be rendered are rendered.\n\n\nEach anchor has its own list of children associated with it, which is what the attachment modes are referreing to - \nprepend\n will insert a child at the front, \nappend\n at the end, and \ninsertAt\n at the specified index. The list of children for a particular anchor, say \n#main /\n, os kept up to date in an observable way so that you can automatically generate anchors as components are attached using \n{{#each @.children.byName.main}}\n#main /\n{{/each}}\n.\n\n\nAn anchored attached child is effectively a component that the host instance doesn't control.",

Then, we need to add a mustache for the image caption:  div class='caption' \n   p {{image.caption}} /p  /div   Finally, let's add some event expressions that we can fill in later:  a class='prev' on-click='@.goto(current - 1)' span laquo; /span /a  !-- ... --  a class='next' on-click='@.goto(current + 1)' span raquo; /span /a   Execute the JavaScript to redraw the view, with the placeholder data that's already there.",

We'll also provide default data for the component, notably to start with the  current  index as  0 .   When providing data for components, you should always use a data function that returns a data dictionary. If you return the same object from each invocation, then all of your component instances will share the same underlying data, but the properties won't necessarily be kept up-to-date across instances.  Component data and instance data is combined into the final instance's data dictionary starting with Ractive default data, moving through the component hierarchy, and ending with the data supplied to the instance constructor.   Let's write our  goto  method:  function ( index ) {\n  var images = this.get( 'images' );\n\n  // handle wrap around\n  var num = ( index + images.length ) % images.length;\n\n  this.set( 'current', num );\n}  Let's add some code to instantiate the slideshow with our gifs. There's a ready-made images variable you can use for this step:  var slideshow = Slideshow({\n  target: '#target',\n  data: { images: images }\n});  Go ahead and execute the code \u2013 you should now have a working slideshow.   Needless to say, you could add as many bells and whistles as you wanted \u2013 fading or sliding transitions, image preloading, thumbnails, touchscreen gesture controls, and so on.  You could, of course, just use an existing image slideshow library. But then you would have to learn that library, and potentially submit to its design philosophy.  Ractive.js is all about flexibility. If you want to change the design or behaviour of a component (say, adding a class name to a particular element), the power to do so is in your hands \u2013 the template is easy to understand and tweak because it's basically just HTML, and the view logic is straightforward.  It's better to be able to build your own solution than to rely on developers maintaining high quality and up-to-date documentation.",

It turns out that that is a pretty simple thing to accomplish. We can register our component with either globally or with our main Ractive.js instance, and anywhere that the template has a  slideshow /  element, Ractive.js will create an instance of  Slideshow  and mount it inline.  Ractive.components.slideshow = Slideshow;\n\n// or\nvar ractive = Ractive({\n    // ...\n\n  components: {\n    slideshow: Slideshow\n  },\n\n  // ...\n});  Now in the template, we just reference the component as if it were a custom element:  div style-height= 40vh \n   slideshow /  /div   We  were  passing the list of pictures to the instance as it was being initialized, but since Ractive.js is now managing the instance, how do we get the list of pictures to the component instance? Well, we create a mapping from the data in the host instance to the  images  keypath in the component by using an attribute:  div style-height= 40vh \n   slideshow images= {{devopsImages}}  /  /div   Update the code with another images array and put two  slideshow  components in the main instance.   Mappings are automatically managed cross-instance  link s. A link is a bit like a filesystem symlink in that the data isn't copied anywhere - it just gets a new path that points to it. Changing the data in either place is effectively the same as changing it everywhere at once.",

Perhaps we could allow the user to have a bit more control over the template by, say, letting them include some sort of disclaimer on all of the slides. We could hard-code the disclaimer in a special version for each client, but that sounds like it would be awful to maintain.  Fortunately, Ractive.js allows you to use the content of a component tag to pass partials to the component instance. Any content not within a  {{#patial}}  tag is collected up and exposed to the component as a partial named  content . Any  {{#partial}} s are supplied to the component instance with the names they are given in the  {{#partial}}  tag. We'll use a disclaimer partial for our component:  slideshow \n  {{#partial disclaimer}} div class= disclaimer I don't know what we're disclaiming, but we're disclaiming it  a on-click= @.disclaim(), false  href= # here /a . /div {{/partial}} /slideshow   We can add a reference to the partial in the  Slideshow  component template:  {{ disclaimer}}   It's not a bad idea to supply a default partial with the component, so that Ractive.js doesn't emit any warnings about missing partials. Any partials passed to the component will override any supplied to  extend .   Now what will happen when you click the \"here\" link? Partials exist completely in the context of the instance in which they are used, and there is no  disclaim  method on the  Slideshow  component, so nothing will happen (except an error will be logged to the console). If you want a passed-in partial to render in the context from which it was passed, you can  {{yield}}  it.  {{yield disclaimer}}  Add a  disclaim  method to the main instance, update the  Slideshow  component, and run the code to see it all in action.   Since  yield  puts the partial in the context of the caller, there's not much point in using it within an  #each  block because the array being iterated is unreachable from the  yield .  yield s can also supply aliases to data local to the component e.g.  {{yield disclaimer with current as currentImage}} .  yield ing the  content  partial just requires dropping the name.",

Ractive.js components actually have a pretty complete set of lifecycle events that allow component authors to hook into just about every stage of a component's lifecycle - from  construct ion to  destruct ion hitting  init ,  render ,  unrender ,  teardown ,  complete  ( render  complete along with any transitions) and a few others in between. Each lifecycle event also happens to be an instance event.  Lets add our check to make sure the  Slideshow  component receives an  image  parameter. There are a few ways to do this, including using  on  and providing an  oninit  function as an initialization parameter.  var ractive = Ractive({\n  // ...\n  on: {\n    init: function () {}\n  },\n  // ...\n});\n\n// or\n\nvar ractive = Ractive({\n  // ...\n  oninit: function () {},\n  // ...\n});\n\n// for other lifecycle events, you can attach after init\n\nractive.on( 'render', function () {} );  Add an  init  event handler that checks to see if there are no images and issues a warning if there are none.",

It turns out that having self-contained components like that is a pretty convenient pattern for managing complexity in a larger app. All of the related functionality for a feature or group of features can be grouped into one Ractive.js extension known as a  view . Each individual view can then be loaded and/or rendered independently.  In order do use views with a main instance controlling the overall app, you would have to have some sort of big  #if / else  block with each view included as a branch. You could also resort to some sort of partial generation scheme. There's an easier way though.  Ractive.js will allow you to attach one independent instance to another using  attachChild , optionally specifying a  target . If you don't specify a target, then the child instance will not be rendered, but if you  do  specify a target, then the instance will be rendered into the first available matching  anchor . An anchor looks like a component or element, but its name always starts with a  # . You may have as many anchors as you like, and they may each have the same or different names.  #anchor /  #ICallThisOneStan \n  Stan has a content partial.\n  {{#partial name}}He also has a name partial.{{/partial}} /ICallThisOneStan   Go ahead and fill out the two provided views as you like, add anchors to the main instance template, and attach an instance of each view to an anchor on the main instance.   You can detach a child using the conveniently named  detachChild  method.  Child instances can be attached in  prepend ,  insertAt , or  append  (the default) mode. Ractive.js will try to find a matching anchor for each child starting with the first. If there aren't enough anchors, some instances will not be rendered. Each time a child is attached or detached, Ractive.js will adjust any affected anchors so all instances that can be rendered are rendered.  Each anchor has its own list of children associated with it, which is what the attachment modes are referreing to -  prepend  will insert a child at the front,  append  at the end, and  insertAt  at the specified index. The list of children for a particular anchor, say  #main / , os kept up to date in an observable way so that you can automatically generate anchors as components are attached using  {{#each @.children.byName.main}} #main / {{/each}} .  An anchored attached child is effectively a component that the host instance doesn't control.",

            "text": "API\n\n\nThis page contains \nall\n of the main API available in Ractive, including that provided by templates. This can be a little bit overwhelming, but it's also very searchable. If you're new to Ractive and not exactly sure what you're looking for, we recommend starting with \nthe tutorial\n to get the basics and circling back here later. Here's a basic breakdown of the sections and what you can find in them:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMustaches\n\n\nThis section describes the main template constructs that are used in Ractive. Plain mustaches \n{{like_this}}\n are used to inject values into the DOM. \n{{#if conditionals}}\n are used to conditionally add or remove content. \n{{#each iterations}}\n are used to display content for every element in a list or object. \n{{#with contexts}}\n are used to scope data for a section of template.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Binding, Directives, Special References\n\n\nThese sections make up the remainder of the template constructs that are used in Ractive. Directives control things like how an element transitions in an out of the DOM, what event listeners are installed on an element, and how two-way bindings are handled. Data Binding describes the different form element bindings available and the special directives that are used to apply them. Special References describes all of the template context-based magic variables that are automatically supplied to your template by Ractive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInitialization Options\n\n\nThese are the options you can pass into a Ractive constructor to control how the instance behaves. Some of them can also be passed to \nextend\n and \nextendWith\n to control how a Ractive component behaves. This is where you'll find how to specify your template, data, event listeners, and observers that define your app, as well as options to control other behavior.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatic Properties\n\n\nThese are properties available either solely on the \nRactive\n constructor singleton or on component constructors that have been created by \nextend\n or augmented by \nextendWith\n. Global plugin registries and prototypes are found here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatic Methods\n\n\nThis is a collection of helper functions that do things like parse a template, provide instance-free access to cross-instance state, create or augment Ractive components, and perform utility functions, like escaping keypaths.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstance Properties\n\n\nThese are mostly instance-local plugin registries, but they also include things like references to parent and root instances for components.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstance Methods\n\n\nAlong with the template and a few init options, these make up your primary interface with Ractive. You can interact with data (\nget\n, \nset\n, \ntoggle\n, array methods), invalidate data (\nupdate\n), find child DOM nodes and components (\nfind\n, \nfindComponent\n, etc), handle event subscriptions (\non\n, \noff\n, etc), manage rendering (\nrender\n, \ninsert\n, \ndetach\n, \nunrender\n), and get a handle to a Context based on a selector or a DOM node (\ngetContext\n).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContext Object\n\n\nContext objects are a handle to a specific point in a template, usually based on a DOM node. They bridge the gap between the template and the DOM, so that you can interact with the template directly. Context objects contain analogs to all of the instance methods available on a Ractive instance, but these methods are scoped to the context with which they are associated. This allows you to do things like set relative paths, check to see if an element has an event directive, and interact with any bindings. Context objects are automatically provided as the first argument to any event listener. They can also be acquired from a template using the \n@context\n special reference and from the API using \ngetContext\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMustaches\n\n\nVariables\n\n\n{{ }}\n, \n{{\n }}\n and \n{{{ }}}\n render a reference. They are also used for binding when used on directives. \n{{ }}\n escapes the reference while \n{{\n }}\n and \n{{{ }}}\n do not.\n\n\nRactive({\n  data: {\n    name: \nChris\n,\n    company: \nb\nGitHub\n/b\n\n  },\n  template: `\n    {{name}}      \n!-- Chris --\n\n    {{age}}       \n!--  --\n\n    {{company}}   \n!-- \nlt;b\ngt;GitHub\nlt;/b\ngt; --\n\n    {{\ncompany}}  \n!-- \nb\nGitHub\n/b\n --\n\n    {{{company}}} \n!-- \nb\nGitHub\n/b\n --\n\n  `\n})\n\n\n\n\nSections\n\n\nSections render a block of markup depending on the value referenced.\n\n\nIf the reference is an array, it renders the block of markup for each item in the array. The context of the section is the value of the currently iterated item. The iteration index is made available by adding a \n:\n after the array reference followed by the index reference.\n\n\nRactive({\n  data: {\n    people: [{name: 'Alice'},{name: 'Bob'},{name: 'Eve'}]\n  },\n  template: `\n    {{#people}} {{name}} {{/people}}\n    {{#people:i}} {{i}} {{name}} {{/people}}\n  `\n})\n\n\n\n\nIf the reference is an object \nand the key reference is provided\n, the section iterates through the object properties. The context of the section is the value of the currently iterated property. The iteration key is made available by adding a \n:\n after the object reference followed by the key reference.\n\n\nRactive({\n  data: {\n    places: { loc1: 'server room', loc2: 'networking lab', loc3: 'pantry'}\n  },\n  template: `\n    {{#places:key}}\n      {{ key }} {{ this }}\n    {{/places}}\n  `\n})\n\n\n\n\nIf the reference is some other truthy value or an object but not providing the iteration key reference, it renders the block of markup using the reference as context.\n\n\nRactive({\n  data: {\n    isAdmin: true,\n    foo: {\n      bar: {\n        baz: {\n          qux: 'Hello, World!'\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  template: `\n    {{#isAdmin}} Hello Admin! {{/isAdmin}}\n\n    {{#foo.bar.baz}} {{qux}} {{/foo.bar.baz}}\n  `\n})\n\n\n\n\nInverted Sections\n\n\n{{^ }}\n renders a block of markup if the reference is falsy or is an empty iterable.\n\n\nRactive({\n  data: {\n    real: false,\n    people: []\n  },\n  template: `\n    {{^real}} Nope, not real {{/real}}\n\n    {{^people}} There's no people {{/people}}\n  `\n})\n\n\n\n\nOptional section closing text\n\n\nRegular (\n{{# }}\n) and inverted (\n{{^ }}\n) sections can be closed with optional closing text. If the closing text is provided and the section is opened with a reference, the closing text must match the opening text. Otherwise, a warning will be issued for the mismatch. If the section is opened with an expression, the closing text will always be ignored.\n\n\nRactive({\n  data: {\n    items: [1,2,3]\n  },\n  template: `\n    {{#items}}\n      {{this}}\n    {{/items}}\n\n    {{#items}}\n      {{this}}\n    {{/}}\n\n    {{# a.concat(b) }}\n      {{this}}\n    {{/ I'm actually ignored but should be something meaningful like a.concat(b) }}\n  `\n})\n\n\n\n\nIf sections\n\n\n{{#if }}\n renders a block of markup if the reference is truthy or a non-empty iterable. \n{{else}}\n and \n{{elseif}}\n are supported and render if the previous condition failed.\n\n\nRactive({\n  data: {\n    foo: false,\n    bar: false\n  },\n  template: `\n    {{#if foo}}\n      foo\n    {{elseif bar}}\n      bar\n    {{else}}\n      baz\n    {{/if}}\n  `\n})\n\n\n\n\nUnless sections\n\n\n{{#unless }}\n renders a block of markup if the reference is falsy or is an empty iterable. Unlike \n{{#if }}\n, the \n{{#unless }}\n section does not support \n{{else}}\n nor \n{{elseif}}\n.\n\n\nRactive({\n  data: {\n    real: false,\n  },\n  template: `\n    {{#unless real}} Fake {{/unless}}\n  `\n})\n\n\n\n\nEach sections\n\n\n{{#each }}\n renders the block of markup for each item in the iterable. The context of the section is the value of the currently iterated item. \n{{else}}\n and \n{{elseif}}\n are supported and render if the iterable is empty. The iterable may be an array or an object, and if it is an object, the keys will be iterated with the context of each iteration being the value at the key associated with it.\n\n\nRactive({\n  data: {\n    people: [{name: 'Alice'},{name: 'Bob'},{name: 'Eve'}]\n  },\n  template: `\n    {{#each people}}\n      Hi! I'm {{.name}}!\n    {{else}}\n      There's nobody here\n    {{/each}}\n  `\n})\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to refer to the item in an iteration by name, you can optionally supply an alias for it.\n\n\n{{#each people as person}}Hi! I'm {{person.name}}!{{/each}}\n\n\n\n\nIf you would also like to refer to the current index or key for an iteration by something other than the special refs \n@key\n and \n@index\n, you can also provide an alias for each of those. When aliasing key and index, only the first key alias is required, and it will always be the same as the index alias for an array because the key and index are the same thing. For an object iteration, the index alias will be the 0-based index of the key in the keys of the object being iterated.\n\n\n{{#each people: index, key}}index and key are the same for an array{{/each}}\n\n!-- this works with a context alias as well --\n\n{{#each people as person: index, key}}...{{/each}}\n\n!-- the second alias is not required --\n\n{{#each people: i}}...{{/each}}\n\n!-- and it's only really useful when iterating an object --\n\n{{#each someObject: k, i}}k is the current key and i is the current index{{/each}}\n\n\n\n\n@index\n and \n@key\n aliases are useful for nested \n{{#each}}\n blocks so that you have a way to refer to the outer key or index in any given iteration. It's also sometimes useful to give a more meaningful name to a key or index.\n\n\nFrom 0.10.0\n\n\nIn addition to a context alias, you can also include aliases for \n@keypath\n, \n@rootpath\n, \n@index\n, and \n@key\n instead of using the \n: k, i\n syntax. This tends to be slightly less confusing than trying to remember whether the first or second name is the key.\n\n\n{{#each people as person, i as @index, path as @keypath}}...{{/each}}\n\n!-- the context alias is not required --\n\n{{#each people, i as @index, path as @keypath}}...{{/each}}\n\n\n\n\nThere are also special aliases that can control the behavior of the \n{{#each}}\n block in special circumstances.\n\n\nFirst, it's not possible to have a computed array shuffle (a keyed update, which moves iterated elements around the DOM to match new array positions rather than simply updating contents in place) because there's no way to tell the computation when an index is moved. With a plain old model, an \n{{#each}}\n block will automatically know how to shuffle itself if you use an array method like \nsplice\n or a \nset\n with the \nshuffle\n option set. By setting the \nshuffle\n alias to either \ntrue\n or a keypath string to use to return an identity for each iteration, you can tell an \n{{#each}}\n with a computed array how to shuffle itself when the array changes. \ntrue\n will cause the identity of each element to be used to determine its new index, and a keypath will cause the identity of the value at that keypath from each element to determine its new index.\n\n\n{{#each people, true as shuffle}}...{{/each}}\n{{#each people, 'profile.id' as shuffle}}...each person's profile id determines where they are in the list...{{/each}}\n\n\n\n\nSecond, computed contexts make two-way binding problematic, as updates don't propagate back to the source model automatically, or expensive, as using \nsyncComputedChildren\n will invalidate everything involved with the computation any time the computed context is changed. The \nsource\n alias of an \n{{#each}}\n block with a computed array can be set to have it map each of its iterations' contexts back to the plain model that is the basis of the computed array.\n\n\n{{#each filter(people, { name: 'joe' }), people as source}}\n  {{@keypath}} will be something like `people.0` rather than a computed\n  keypath based on `filter(people, { name: 'joe' }).0`\n{{/each}}\n\n\n\n\nThe \nas\n in aliases is also optional, so \n{{#each people person, @index i}}\n is equivalent to \n{{#each people as person, @index as i}}\n.\n\n\nWith sections\n\n\n{{#with }}\n alters the current section's context by sticking a reference in front of the resolution order.

Defaults to \nundefined\n.\n\n\nYou can supply a list of optional attributes using an array. You can also supply an object with an \noptional\n array of attribute names and a \nrequired\n array of attribute names. At runtime, if a component is created missing a required attribute, Ractive will issue a warning about missing required attributes. Any attributes that are passed to the component that are \nnot\n included in either of the \noptional\n or \nrequired\n lists of attributes will be collected into a partial named \nextra-attributes\n so that they can be included on a top-level element in the component template or split apart to be used in a component \ninit\n event.\n\n\nconst Component = Ractive.extend({\n  template: `\ndiv class-component-wrapper {{yield extra-attributes}}\nFancy component doing something with list and type\n/div\n`,\n  attributes: {\n    required: [ 'list' ],\n    optional: [ 'type' ]\n  }\n})\n\n// \nComponent type=\nfoo\n /\n will issue a warning about missing list\n// \nComponent list=\n{{things}}\n style-color=\ngreen\n /\n will not warn, but will include the style-color=\ngreen\n on the wrapper div\n\n\n\n\nThe extra attributes passed to a component are not limited to simple attributes - they can also include directives, but any mustache sections will not have their contents checked. By default, the \nextra-attributes\n will \nnot\n be mapped, meaning that the values won't be available with \nget\n from the component, so the partial should be yielded. If you need the extra attributes to be mapped, include an additional setting in the attributes map \nmapAll: true\n.\n\n\ncomponents\n\n\n(Object\nstring, Function|Promise)\n\n\nA map of components available to the instance or component being configured. The key is the registered name of the component, which is used in the template.\n\n\nA component can be registered statically by assinging a component definition.\n\n\nconst MyStaticComponent = Ractive.extend({ ... })\n\nconst MyComponent = Ractive.extend({\n  components: { MyStaticComponent },\n  template: `\n    \nMyStaticComponent /\n\n  `\n})\n\n\n\n\nA component can be registered dynamically by assinging a function that returns either a component definition, or a name of a registered component. The function receives \ndata\n as first argument.\n\n\nRactive.components.GlobalComponent = Ractive.extend({ ... })\n\nconst NonGlobalComponent = Ractive.extend({ ... })\n\nconst MyComponent = Ractive.extend({\n  data: { isGlobal: false },\n  components: {\n    MyDynamicComponent: (data) =\n data.isGlobal ? 'GlobalComponent' : NonGlobalComponent\n  },\n  template: `\n    \nMyDynamicComponent /\n\n  `\n})\n\n\n\n\nA component can be loaded asynchronously by assingning a promise that resolves with a component definition.\n\n\n // Assuming MyAsyncComponent.js does `export default Ractive.extend({ ... })`\n\nconst MyComponent = Ractive.extend({\n  components: {\n    MyAsyncComponent: import('./path/to/MyAsyncComponent.js')\n  },\n  template: `\n    \nMyAsyncComponent /\n\n  `\n})\n\n\n\n\nA component can be loaded lazily by assinging a function that returns a promise that resolves with a component definition. Ractive only loads the component when it's being rendered.\n\n\n // Assuming MyAsyncComponent.js does `export default Ractive.extend({ ... })`\n\nconst MyComponent = Ractive.extend({\n  components: {\n    MyAsyncComponent: () =\n import('./path/to/MyAsyncComponent.js')\n  },\n  template: `\n    \nMyAsyncComponent /\n\n  `\n})\n\n\n\n\nIn both asynchronous cases, instances will be rendered immediately while the asynchronous components load. Once the asynchronous components are available, their placeholders will be re-rendered. Two reserved partial names, \nasync-loading\n and \nasync-loaded\n, can be used to define markup when the asynchronous component is loading and loaded, respectively. A special partial named \ncomponent\n is also available to render the component's contents inside \nasync-loaded\n.\n\n\n // Assuming MyAsyncComponent.js does `export default Ractive.extend({ ... })`\n\nconst MyComponent = Ractive.extend({\n  components: {\n    MyAsyncComponent: import('./path/to/MyAsyncComponent.js')\n  },\n  template: `\n    \nspan\nI'm rendered immediately.

If the return value changes, the Ractive instance will be re-rendered.\n\n\ncomputed\n\n\n(Object\nstring, function|Object\n)\n\n\nA map of computed properties where the key is the name of the computed property and the value is either a computed property expression, a function that returns a value, or an object that has \nget\n and \nset\n functions.\n\n\n// Imagine a square...\ncomputed: {\n  // Computed property expression\n  diagonal: '${side} * Math.sqrt(2)',\n\n  // A function\n  perimeter () {\n    return 4 * this.get('side')\n  },\n\n  // An object with get and set functions\n  area: {\n    get () {\n      return Math.pow(this.get('side'), 2)\n    },\n    set (value) {\n      this.set('side', Math.sqrt(value))\n    }\n  },\n}\n\n\n\n\ncsp\n\n\n(boolean)\n\n\nWhether or not to add inline functions for expressions after parsing. Defaults to \nfalse\n.\n\n\nThis can effectively eliminate \neval\n caused by expressions in templates. It also makes the resulting template no longer JSON compatible, so the template will have to be served via \nscript\n tag.\n\n\ncss\n\n\n(string|function)\n\n\nScoped CSS for a component and its descendants.\n\n\ncss: `\n  .bold { font-weight: bold }\n`\n\n\n\n\nAt the moment, only applies to components.\n\n\n// This works\nconst Component = Ractive.extend({\n  css: '...'\n})\n\n// This will not work\nRactive({\n  css: '...'\n})\n\n\n\n\nFrom 0.9.4\n, if \ncss\n is a function, the function will be called with a handle to the component's style data and is expected to return a string of CSS.\n\n\nconst Component = Ractive.extend({\n  css(data) {\n    // you can use Ractive.styleSet('colors.special', 'pink') or Component.styleSet('colors.special', 'pink')\n    // at any time to override the default here, which is green\n    return `\n      .super-special { color: ${data('colors.special') || 'green'}; }\n    `\n  }\n})\n\n\n\n\ncssData\n\n\nFrom 0.9.4\n\n\n(object)\n\n\nLike \ncss\n, this also only applies to components. This is the default data for a component's style computation, if it has one. It is inherited from parent components all the way back to Ractive, and any changes that are made at any point in the hierarchy are automatically propagated down from that point. This means that if a component uses \nfoo\n in its style computation but does not define a value for it in its \ncssData\n, then calling \nRactive.styleSet('foo', ...)\n will cause the component style to recompute.\n\n\ncssId\n\n\n(string)\n\n\nThis value is used to scope CSS defined on a component's \ncss\n initialization option only to the instances of the component. By default, the value is a randomly generated UUID.\n\n\ndata\n\n\n(Object\nstring, any\n|Function)\n\n\nThe data for an instance, or default data for a component. Can either be an object or a function that returns an object.\n\n\n// Object form\ndata: {\n  foo: 'bar'\n}\n\n// Function form\ndata () {\n  return { foo: 'bar' }\n}\n\n// Function form using arrow function for less verbosity\ndata: () =\n ({\n  foo: 'bar'\n})\n\n\n\n\nWhen using the object form, the data is attached to the component's prototype. Standard prototype rules apply.\n\n\nconst Component = Ractive.extend({\n  data: {\n    foo: { bar: 42 }\n  }\n})\n\nvar component1 = Component()\nvar component2 = Component()\ncomponent1.set( 'foo.bar', 12 )\ncomponent2.get( 'foo.bar' ); // returns 12\n\n\n\n\nWhen using the function form, the function is executed to give each instance a copy of the data. Standard prototype rules apply.\n\n\nconst Component = Ractive.extend({\n  data () {\n    return {\n      foo: { bar: 42 }\n    }\n  }\n})\n\nvar component1 = Component()\nvar component2 = Component()\ncomponent1.set( 'foo.bar', 12 )\ncomponent2.get( 'foo.bar' ); // returns 42\n\n\n\n\nWhen extending from a constructor, data from the parent constructor will be shallow-copied over to the child data. Child data takes precedence in the event of collisions.\n\n\nconst Parent = Ractive.extend({\n  data: {\n    foo: 'Hello',\n    bar: 'World'\n  }\n})\n\nconst Child = Parent.extend({\n  data: {\n    foo: 'Goodbye'\n  }\n})\n\nParent().get(); // { foo: 'Hello', bar: 'World' }\nChild().get();  // { foo: 'Goodbye', bar: 'World' }\n\n\n\n\ndecorators\n\n\n(Object\nstring, Function\n)\n\n\nA map of decorators where the key is the decorator name and the value is a decorator definition.\n\n\ndecorators: {\n  MyDecorator: DecoratorDefinition\n}\n\n\n\n\ndelegate\n\n\n(boolean)\n\n\nWhether or not to enable automatic event delegation for iterative sections within an element. Defaults to \ntrue\n.\n\n\nWhen enabled, DOM events subscribed within iterative sections will not add a DOM event listener to each element. Instead, a single listener will be installed on the element containing the iterative section, and that listener will find appropriate event directives starting from the target element and working back to the containing element with the listener.\n\n\ndelimiters\n\n\n(Array[string])\n\n\nSets the template delimiters. Defaults to \n[ '{{', '}}' ]\n.\n\n\ndelimiters: [ '\n%=', '%\n' ],\ntemplate: 'hello \n%= world %\n',\ndata: { world: 'earth' }\n\n// result:\n// hello earth\n\n\n\n\neasing\n\n\n(Object\nstring, Function\n)\n\n\nA map of easing functions where the key is the easing function name and the value is the easing function.\n\n\neasing: {\n  MyEasing: EasingDefinition\n}\n\n\n\n\nel\n\n\n(string|HTMLElement|array-like)\n\n\nThe element to render an instance to. Can either be an \nid\n of the element, a CSS selector to an element, an HTML element, or an array-like object whose first item is an HTML element.\n\n\nel: 'container'\nel: '#container'\nel: document.getElementById('container')\nel: jQuery('#container')\n\n\n\n\nenhance\n\n\n(boolean)\n\n\nWhether or not to apply progressive enhancement by inspecting the contents of \nel\n and try to reuse as much of the existing tree as possible. Defaults to \nfalse\n.\n\n\nThere are a few limitations to this feature:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis option cannot be used with \nappend\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnescaped HTML mustaches (triples) don't play nicely with enhance because there's no easy way to match up the string content to the target DOM nodes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll matching elements will be reused, except for a few cases regarding text nodes.\n\n\ndiv\nleft text {{#if foo}} middle text {{/if}} right text\n/div\n\n\nHTML does not have markup representation for adjacent text nodes. Rendering the snippet above from the server, regardless of \nfoo\n's value, the browser creates one contiguous text node. However, Ractive will need \nthree\n adjacent text nodes to represent it: One for \nouter text\n, another for \nright text\n and another for \nmiddle text\n when \nfoo\n becomes truthy.\n\n\nIt has been suggested that Ractive could deal with merged text nodes, but that would lead to extra complexity as there are certain scenarios where the text node would have to split and rejoin. When \nfoo\n is falsey, \nleft text\n and \nright text\n could be merged. But when \nfoo\n becomes truthy, that text node would have to split in order to accomodate \nmiddle text\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nevents\n\n\n(Object\nstring, Function\n)\n\n\nA map of events where the key is the event name and value is an event definition.\n\n\nevents: {\n  MyEvent: EventDefinition\n}\n\n\n\n\ninterpolate\n\n\n(Object\nstring, boolean\n)\n\n\nA map of elements that controls whether or not interpolation is allowed within the element. If an element is present in the map, then nested tags are treated as text rather than elements, as in a \nscript\n tag. If the value associated with the element is \nfalse\n, mustaches within the element are also treated as text rather than blocks or interpolators.\n\n\ninterpolate: {\n  textarea: true,\n  script: true,\n  style: true,\n  template: true\n}\n\n\n\n\ninterpolators\n\n\n(Object\nstring, Function\n)\n\n\nA map of interpolators where the key is the interpolator name and the value is an interpolator definition.\n\n\ninterpolators: {\n  MyInterpolator: InterpolatorDefinition\n}\n\n\n\n\nisolated\n\n\n(boolean)\n\n\nControls whether the component will try to resolve data and plugins on its ancestors. Defaults to \ntrue\n.\n\n\nRelevant only to Components.\n\n\nlazy\n\n\n(boolean|number)\n\n\nWhether or not to update data using late-firing DOM events (i.e. \nchange\n, \nblur\n) instead of events that fire immediately on interaction (i.e. \nkeyup\n, \nkeydown\n). Defaults to \nfalse\n.\n\n\nvar ractive = Ractive({\n  lazy: true,\n  data: { foo: 'bar' },\n  template: `\n    \ninput value=\n{{foo}}\n\n\n    \n!-- Updates when the input loses focus --\n\n    {{ foo }}\n  `\n})\n\n\n\n\nlazy\n also accepts a number value, a millisecond value, that indicates the delay between the last UI interaction and Ractive updating the data. Losing element focus is not required for the update to kick in.\n\n\nvar ractive = Ractive({\n  lazy: 1000,\n  data: { foo: 'bar' },\n  template: `\n    \ninput value=\n{{foo}}\n\n\n    \n!-- Updates 1000ms after the last interaction on input --\n\n    {{ foo }}\n  `\n})\n\n\n\n\nlazy\n is only applicable if \ntwoway\n is \ntrue\n.\n\n\nnestedTransitions\n\n\n(boolean)\n\n\nWhether or not to allow transitions to fire if they are already downstream from a transitioning element.

If \nnestedTransitions\n is disabled, then the \nfly\n transition on inner \ndiv\n will not be run, since the \nfade\n will already be running on the outer \ndiv\n.\n\n\nThis can also be controlled per transition using the \nnested\n boolean parameter for transitions:\n\n\ndiv fade-in=\n{ duration: 'slow', nested: false }\n...\n/div\n\n\n\n\n\nnoCssTransform\n\n\n(boolean)\n\n\nPrevents component CSS from being transformed with scoping guids.

Defaults to \nundefined\n.\n\n\nThe keys of the hash may be any string that is accepted by \nractive.observe()\n, and the values may be either callback functions, as would be passed to \nractive.observe()\n, or objects with a \nhandler\n property that is a callback function. The object form also takes other options that control the behavior of the observer.\n\n\nRactive({\n  // ..\n  observe: {\n    show ( value ) {\n      console.log( `show changed to '${value}'` )\n    },\n    'users.*.name people.*.name': {\n      handler ( value, old, path, idx ) {\n        console.log( `${path} changed to '${value}'` )\n      },\n      init: false,\n      strict: true\n    }\n  }\n})\n\n\n\n\nThe options that may be specified in the object form are (see the \nractive.observe()\n docs for more detailed option descriptions):\n\n\n\n\nhandler (Function)\n: The callback function for the observer.\n\n\nonce (boolean)\n: Use \nractive.observeOnce()\n rather than \nractive.observe()\n to install the observer, meaning the observer is implicitly \ninit: false\n, will only fire for the first change to the observed path, and will by removed after the first change.\n\n\nstrict (boolean)\n: Use strict equality when determining whether or not a value has changed.\n\n\narray (boolean)\n: Use an array observer rather than a plain observer.\n\n\ndefer (boolean)\n: Defer the observer until after the DOM is settled.\n\n\ninit (boolean)\n: Whether or not to fire an initial change event.\n\n\nlinks (boolean)\n: Whether or not to follow links.\n\n\ncontext (any)\n: Context for the callback function.\n\n\nold (Function)\n: Modifier function for the \nold\n value passed to the callback function.\n\n\n\n\nWhen a sublcass created with \nRactive.extend()\n is passed an \nobserve\n hash, then any further subclasses or instances created with an \nobserve\n hash will be combined. Any superclass observers are installed first following the inheritance hierarchy, and finally, any instance observers are installed.\n\n\non\n\n\n(Object\nstring, Function|Object\n)\n\n\nA hash of event listeners to subscribe during initialization and unsubscribe during teardown. Defaults to \nundefined\n.\n\n\nThe keys of the hash may be any string that is accepted by \nractive.on()\n, and the values may be either callback functions, as would be passed to \nractive.on()\n, or objects with a \nhandler\n property that is a callback function.

Defaults to \nfalse\n.\n\n\ntrue\n strips out blacklisted elements and event attributes. See \nRactive.parse()\n for the default list of blacklisted elements.\n\n\ntemplate: `\n  \np\nsome content\n/p\n\n  \nframe\nAm I a bad element or just misunderstood?\n/frame\n\n`,\nsanitize: true\n\n// result:\n// \np\nsome content\n/p\n\n\n\n\n\nThe object form should have \nelements\n which is an array of blacklisted elements and \neventAttributes\n boolean which, when \ntrue\n, also strips out event attributes.\n\n\ntemplate: `\n  \np\nsome content\n/p\n\n  \ndiv onclick=\ndoEvil()\nthe good stuff\n/div\n\n`,\nsanitize: {\n  elements: [ 'p' ],\n  eventAttributes: true\n}\n\n// result:\n// \ndiv\nthe good stuff\n/div\n\n\n\n\n\nstaticDelimiters\n\n\n(Array[string])\n\n\nSets the static (one-time binding) delimiters.

Defaults to \nfalse\n. \nNote\n: setting this to \ntrue\n may cause performance issues for complex expressions involving large arrays.\n\n\ninput value=\n{{pattern}}\n /\n\n{{#each filter(users, pattern)}}\n  \ninput value=\n{{.name}}\n /\n\n{{/each}}\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, the \ninput\n inside the iteration is bound to a computation e.g. \nfilter(users, pattern).0.name\n that isn't actually an addressable model. With \nsyncComputedChildren\n enabled, when that virtual keypath is updated by a user changing the \ninput\n, the expression will invalidate its dependencies (\nfilter\n, \nusers\n, and \npattern\n), which will cause any other references to the \nuser\n that happens to coincide with result of the expression to also update.\n\n\ntarget\n\n\n(string|HTMLElement|array-like)\n\n\nAlias for \nel\n.\n\n\ntemplate\n\n\n(string|array|object|function)\n\n\nThe template to use. Must either be a CSS selector string pointing to an element on the page containing the template, an HTML string, an object resulting from \nRactive.parse()\n or a function that returns any of the previous options.

If the return value changes, the Ractive instance will be re-rendered.\n\n\ntransitions\n\n\n(Object\nstring, Function\n)\n\n\nA map of transitions where the key is the name of the transition and the value is a transition definition.\n\n\ntransitionsEnabled\n\n\n(boolean)\n\n\nWhether or not transitions are enabled. Defaults to \ntrue\n.\n\n\ntripleDelimiters\n\n\n(Array[string])\n\n\nSets the triple delimiters.

Defaults to \nfalse\n.\n\n\nAmbiguous references can be the cause of some strange behavior when your data changes structure slightly. With \nwarnAboutAmbiguity\n enabled, Ractive will warn you any time a reference isn't scoped and resolves in a context above the immediate context of the reference.\n\n\nStatic Properties\n\n\nRactive.adaptors\n\n\n(Object\nstring, Object\n)\n\n\nThe registry of globally available adaptors.\n\n\nRactive.components\n\n\n(Object\nstring, Function\n)\n\n\nThe registry of globally available component definitions.\n\n\nRactive.Context\n\n\nFrom 0.9.4\n\n\n(Object)\n\n\nThe prototype for \nContext\n objects.

Where possible, \nrequestAnimationFrame\n is used rather than \nsetTimeout\n.\n\n\nNumeric values and strings that can be parsed as numeric values can be interpolated. Objects and arrays containing numeric values (or other objects and arrays which themselves contain numeric values, and so on recursively) are also interpolated.\n\n\nNote that there is currently no mechanism for detecting cyclical structures! Animating to a value that indirectly references itself will cause an infinite loop.\n\n\nFuture versions of Ractive may include string interpolators - e.g. for SVG paths, colours, transformations and so on, a la D3 - and the ability to pass in your own interpolator.\n\n\nIf an animation is started on a keypath which is \nalready\n being animated, the first animation is cancelled. (Currently, there is no mechanism in place to prevent collisions between e.g. \nractive.animate('foo', { bar: 1 })\n and \nractive.animate('foo.bar', 0)\n.)\n\n\nSyntax\n\n\n\n\nractive.animate(keypath, value[, options])\n\n\n\n\nArguments\n\n\n\n\nkeypath (string)\n: The keypath to animate.\n\n\nvalue (number|string|Object|Array)\n: The value to animate to.\n\n\n[options] (Object)\n:\n\n\n[duration] (number)\n: How many milliseconds the animation should run for.

Defaults to \nlinear\n.\n\n\n[interpolator] (string)\n: The name of an interpolator function. Defaults to the built-in number interpolator if the value is numeric, or \nnull\n if none is applicable.\n\n\n[step] (Function)\n: A function called on each step of the animation.\n\n\nt (number)\n: The animation progress between \n0\n and \n1\n with easing function already applied.\n\n\nvalue (number)\n: The value at \nt\n with interpolator function already applied.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[complete] (Function)\n: A function to be called when the animation completes, with the \nvalue\n passed to \nanimate\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturns\n\n\n\n\n(Promise)\n: Returns a Promise which resolves with the target \nvalue\n and has an additional \nstop\n method, which cancels the animation.\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n\n\n\n\nvar r = Ractive({\n  el: '#main',\n  template: '#tpl',\n  data: {\n    counter: 0\n  }\n})\n\nsetTimeout(() =\n {\n  r.animate('counter', 20, { duration: 2000 })\n}, 1000)\n\n\n\n\nractive.attachChild()\n\n\nCreates a parent-child relationship between two Ractive instances.

If a child has no specified target, then it is responsible for managing its own render cycle. If a child does have a specified target, then the parent will manage rendering and unrendering the child as appropriate in the same way that a regular component has a managed render cycle.\n\n\nWhen a child is attached targeting an anchor, only anchors that belong directly to the parent are considered as hosts. However, any element or component queries on the parent instance, including live queries, will consider the child when trying to match both elements and components.

Since Ractive can't always watch the contents of objects, copying an object to two different keypaths in your data usually leads to one or both of them getting out of sync. \nlink\n creates a sort of symlink between the two paths so that Ractive knows they are actually the same object. This is particularly useful for master/detail scenarios where you have a complex list of data and you want to be able to select an item to edit in a detail form.\n\n\nSyntax\n\n\n\n\nractive.link(source, destination, options)\n\n\n\n\nArguments\n\n\n\n\nsource (string)\n: The keypath of the source item.\n\n\ndestination (string)\n: The keypath to use as the destination - or where you'd like the data 'copied'.\n\n\noptions (hash)\n:\n\n\ninstance\n or \nractive\n: The Ractive instance in which to find the source keyapth. This allows cross-instance linking much like mapped paths between components.\n\n\nkeypath\n: \nFrom 0.9.4\n - The keypath to register as the source of the link. This is an advanced option that allows you to specify how the link should shuffle. For instance \nitems.0.name\n will never shuffle, but if the keypath is specified as \n.name\n, then it will shuffle when \nitems.0\n shuffles.\n\n\n\n\nReturns\n\n\n\n\n(Promise)\n: Returns a promise.\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n\nractive.link( 'some.nested.0.list.25.item', 'current' )\nractive.set( 'current.name', 'Rich' ); // some.nested.0.list.25.item.name is also updated to be 'Rich'\n\n\n\n\nThis can be used to great effect with method events and the \n@keypath\n special ref:\n\n\n{{#each some.nested}}\n  {{#each list}}\n    {{#with item}}\n      {{.name}}\n      \nbutton on-click=\nevent.link('.', 'current')\nSelect\n/button\n\n    {{/with}}\n  {{/each}}\n{{/each}}\n\nName: \ninput value=\n{{~/current.name}}\n /\n\n\n\n\n\nLinks can be removed using \nractive.unlink()\n.\n\n\nractive.observe()\n\n\nObserves the data at a particular keypath. Unless specified otherwise, the callback will be fired immediately, with \nundefined\n as \noldValue\n. Thereafter it will be called whenever the \nobserved keypath\n changes.\n\n\nSyntax\n\n\n\n\nractive.observe(keypath, callback[, options])\n\n\nractive.observe(map[, options])\n\n\n\n\nArguments\n\n\n\n\n\n\nkeypath (String)\n: The keypath to observe, or a group of space-separated keypaths. Any of the keys can be a \n*\n character, which is treated as a wildcard. A \n**\n means recursive.\n\n\nThe difference between \n*\n and \n**\n is that \n*\n provides your callback function \nvalue\n and \nkeypath\n arguments containing the path of the what actually changed, at any level of the keypath. So instead of getting the same parent value on every change, you get the changed value from whatever arbitrarily deep keypath changed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncallback (Function)\n: The function that will be called, with \nnewValue\n, \noldValue\n and \nkeypath\n as arguments (see Observers for more nuance regarding these arguments), whenever the observed keypath changes value. By default the function will be called with \nractive\n as \nthis\n. Any wildcards in the keypath will have their matches passed to the callback at the end of the arguments list as well.\n\n\n\n\nmap (Object)\n: A map of keypath-observer pairs.\n\n\n[options] (Object)\n:\n\n\n[init] (boolean)\n: Defaults to \ntrue\n. Whether or not to initialise the observer, i.e. call the function with the current value of \nkeypath\n as the first argument and \nundefined\n as the second.\n\n\n[defer] (boolean)\n: Defaults to \nfalse\n, in which case observers will fire before any DOM changes take place. If \ntrue\n, the observer will fire once the DOM has been updated.\n\n\nlinks] (boolean)\n: Defaults to \nfalse\n.  Whether or not the observer should \"follow through\" any links created with [\nractive.link()\n.\n\n\n[strict] (boolean)\n: Defaults to \nfalse\n. \nstrict\n uses object identity to determine if there was a change, meaning that unless the primary object changed, it won't trigger the observer. For example with \n{ data: { foo: { bar: 'baz' } } }\n, \nractive.observe('foo', ..., { strict: true })\n will not fire on \nractive.set('foo.bar', 'bat')\n but will on \nractive.set('foo', { bar: 'bip' })\n.\n\n\n[context] (any)\n: Defaults to \nractive\n. The context the observer is called in (i.e. the value of \nthis\n)\n\n\n[array] (boolean)\n: Defaults to \nfalse\n. Whether or not to observe the keypath as an array, meaning that change events will fire with a object containing two lists, \ninserted\n containing added elements, and \ndeleted\n containing removed elements. There is also a \nstart\n integer property indicating the index at which the replacements begin.\n\n\n[old] (function)\n: Defaults to \nundefined\n. A function that can be used to modify the \nold\n value passed to the observer callback. This can be used to freeze the old value, create a deep clone of it for future firings, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturns\n\n\n\n\n(Object)\n: A handle object for controlling any observers created by the call to \nobserve\n\n\ncancel\n: Permanently stops observers controlled by the handle.\n\n\nisSilenced\n: Returns \ntrue\n if this handle is currently silenced.\n\n\nsilence\n: Stop calling callbacks associated with this handle. The observers are still processed by Ractive, so the old value will still be updated. This means that setting a new value on an observer while it is silenced, resuming the observer, and then setting the same value again will \nnot\n result in the callback being fired if it would not be fired by the same sequence without silencing.\n\n\nresume\n: Resume calling callbacks associated with this handle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n\n// TODO\n\n\n\n\nNote that you can observe keypath \npatterns\n...\n\n\nractive.observe( 'items.*.status', function ( newValue, oldValue, keypath) {\n  var index = /items.(\\d+).status/.exec( keypath )[1]\n  alert( 'item ' + index + ' status changed from ' + oldValue + ' to ' + newValue )\n})\n\n\n\n\n...or multiple space-separated keypaths simultaneously:\n\n\nractive.observe( 'foo bar baz', function ( newValue, oldValue, keypath ) {\n  alert( keypath ) + ' changed from ' + oldValue + ' to ' + newValue )\n})\n\n\n\n\nSee Observers for more detail.\n\n\nractive.observeOnce()\n\n\nObserves the data at a particular keypath until the first change.

The context the observer is called in (i.e. the value of \nthis\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReturns\n\n\n\n\n(Object)\n: An object with a \ncancel\n method, for cancelling the observer.\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n\n// TODO\n\n\n\n\nNote that you can observe keypath \npatterns\n...\n\n\nractive.observeOnce( 'items.*.status', function ( newValue, oldValue, keypath ) {\n  var index = /items.(\\d+).status/.exec( keypath )[1]\n  alert( 'item ' + index + ' status changed from ' + oldValue + ' to ' + newValue )\n})\n\n\n\n\n...or multiple space-separated keypaths simultaneously:\n\n\nractive.observeOnce( 'foo bar baz', function ( newValue, oldValue, keypath ) {\n  alert( keypath + ' changed from ' + oldValue + ' to ' + newValue )\n})\n\n\n\n\nSee Observers for more detail.\n\n\nractive.off()\n\n\nRemoves an event handler, several event handlers, or all event handlers.\n\n\nTo remove a single handler, you must specify both the event name and the handler. If you only specify the event name, all handlers bound to that event name will be removed. If you specify neither event name nor handler, \nall\n event handlers will be removed.\n\n\nAn alternative way to remove event handlers is to use the \ncancel\n method of the return value of a call to \nractive.on()\n.\n\n\nSyntax\n\n\n\n\nractive.off([eventName[, handler]])\n\n\n\n\nArguments\n\n\n\n\neventName (string)\n: The event name to which this handler is currently bound.\n\n\nhandler (Function)\n: The handler to remove.\n\n\n\n\nReturns\n\n\n\n\n(Ractive)\n: Returns the \nractive\n instance to allow this call to be chainable.\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n\n// TODO\n\n\n\n\nractive.on()\n\n\nSubscribe to events.\n\n\nSyntax\n\n\n\n\nractive.on(eventName, handler)\n\n\nractive.on(obj)\n\n\n\n\nArguments\n\n\n\n\neventName (String)\n: The name of the event to subscribe to\n\n\nhandler (Function)\n: The function that will be called, with \nractive\n as \nthis\n.

When all CSS went in \nstyle\n elements in \nhead\n? When all JS went in \nscript\n elements just before \n/body\n? When all HTML was written in Mustache inside inert \nscript\n elements? When it felt good when everything just worked after a page refresh? Ractive remembers, and it's bringing those good times back with component files.\n\n\nRactive component files are simply self-contained HTML files that define a component and contains all the markup, data, styles and logic it needs. It's also designed with dependency management in mind, allowing it to declare library and component dependencies. Best of all, component files are written in the same way regardless of the development process involved, build step or none.\n\n\nExample component file\n\n\n!-- Example component file --\n\n\n\n!-- Import a component named Foo from the file foo.html. --\n\n\nlink rel='ractive' href='foo.html' name='foo'\n\n\n\n!-- Define the markup for this component. --\n\n\nh1\n{{ title }}\n/h1\n\n\n\n!-- Use imported foo component --\n\n\np\nThis is an imported 'foo' component: \nfoo/\n/p\n\n\n\n!-- Define the styles for this component. --\n\n\nstyle\n\n  p { color: red; }\n\n/style\n\n\n\n!-- Define the behavior for this component. --\n\n\nscript\n\nconst $ = require( 'jquery' )\n\ncomponent.exports = {\n  onrender () {\n    $('\np /\n').text('component rendered').insertAfter($this.find('p'))\n  },\n  data: {\n    title: 'Hello World!'\n  }\n}\n\n/script\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above component file roughly translates to the following in vanilla JS:\n\n\nimport Ractive from 'ractive'\nimport $ from 'jquery'\nimport foo from './foo.html'\n\nexport default Ractive.extend({\n  components: { foo },\n  onrender () {\n    $('\np /\n').text('component rendered').insertAfter($this.find('p'))\n  },\n  data: {\n    title: 'Hello World!'\n  },\n  template: `\n    \nh1\n{{ title }}\n/h1\n\n    \np\nThis is an imported 'foo' component: \nfoo/\n/p\n\n  `,\n  css: `\n    p { color: red; }\n  `\n})\n\n\n\n\nWriting\n\n\nlink rel=\"ractive\"\n\n\nTop-level \nlink rel=\"ractive\"\n elements define dependencies on other components. It accepts two attributes:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhref\n - The path to the required component file. Paths that start with \n./\n or \n../\n are resolved relative to the importing component file. Otherwise, resolution is loader-specific.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname\n (optional) - The registered name of the component. This corresponds to the key used in the \ncomponents\n initialization option. When not defined, the filename of the dependency will be used as the name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe names and the loaded dependency will be assigned to the component's \ncomponents\n initialization option.\n\n\nstyle\n\n\nTop-level \nstyle\n elements define the styles for the component. If more than one \nstyle\n element is found on the component file, their contents are concatenated in the order of appearance of the \nstyle\n elements. Contents of these elements will be concatenated and assigned to the component's \ncss\n initialization option.\n\n\nscript\n\n\nA top-level \nscript\n defines the component's initialization. The script's scope has a \ncomponent\n object that is similar to Node's \nmodule\n object. Initialization options for the component is expected via \ncomponent.exports\n. It also has a special \nrequire\n function that fetches script dependencies. \nrequire\n's behavior depends on the loader used. Refer to the specific loader's documentation to know more.\n\n\nThere can only ever be one \nscript\n in a component file. Defining more than one will result in the loader throwing an error.\n\n\nTemplate\n\n\nAfter yanking out top-level \nlink rel=\"ractive\"\n, \nstyle\n or \nscript\n from the component file, anything that's left becomes a part of the template. The remaining markup will be assigned to the component's \ntemplate\n initialization option.\n\n\nUsing\n\n\nIn order to use component files, you will have to use \nloaders\n, Head over to \nthe loaders page\n to learn more about loaders and help you choose a loader that suits your needs.",

            "text": "This page contains  all  of the main API available in Ractive, including that provided by templates. This can be a little bit overwhelming, but it's also very searchable. If you're new to Ractive and not exactly sure what you're looking for, we recommend starting with  the tutorial  to get the basics and circling back here later. Here's a basic breakdown of the sections and what you can find in them:    Mustaches  This section describes the main template constructs that are used in Ractive. Plain mustaches  {{like_this}}  are used to inject values into the DOM.  {{#if conditionals}}  are used to conditionally add or remove content.  {{#each iterations}}  are used to display content for every element in a list or object.  {{#with contexts}}  are used to scope data for a section of template.    Data Binding, Directives, Special References  These sections make up the remainder of the template constructs that are used in Ractive. Directives control things like how an element transitions in an out of the DOM, what event listeners are installed on an element, and how two-way bindings are handled. Data Binding describes the different form element bindings available and the special directives that are used to apply them. Special References describes all of the template context-based magic variables that are automatically supplied to your template by Ractive.    Initialization Options  These are the options you can pass into a Ractive constructor to control how the instance behaves. Some of them can also be passed to  extend  and  extendWith  to control how a Ractive component behaves. This is where you'll find how to specify your template, data, event listeners, and observers that define your app, as well as options to control other behavior.    Static Properties  These are properties available either solely on the  Ractive  constructor singleton or on component constructors that have been created by  extend  or augmented by  extendWith . Global plugin registries and prototypes are found here.     Static Methods  This is a collection of helper functions that do things like parse a template, provide instance-free access to cross-instance state, create or augment Ractive components, and perform utility functions, like escaping keypaths.    Instance Properties  These are mostly instance-local plugin registries, but they also include things like references to parent and root instances for components.    Instance Methods  Along with the template and a few init options, these make up your primary interface with Ractive. You can interact with data ( get ,  set ,  toggle , array methods), invalidate data ( update ), find child DOM nodes and components ( find ,  findComponent , etc), handle event subscriptions ( on ,  off , etc), manage rendering ( render ,  insert ,  detach ,  unrender ), and get a handle to a Context based on a selector or a DOM node ( getContext ).    Context Object  Context objects are a handle to a specific point in a template, usually based on a DOM node. They bridge the gap between the template and the DOM, so that you can interact with the template directly. Context objects contain analogs to all of the instance methods available on a Ractive instance, but these methods are scoped to the context with which they are associated. This allows you to do things like set relative paths, check to see if an element has an event directive, and interact with any bindings. Context objects are automatically provided as the first argument to any event listener. They can also be acquired from a template using the  @context  special reference and from the API using  getContext .",

I'm {{.name}}!\n    {{else}}\n      There's nobody here\n    {{/each}}\n  `\n})  If you want to refer to the item in an iteration by name, you can optionally supply an alias for it.  {{#each people as person}}Hi! I'm {{person.name}}!{{/each}}  If you would also like to refer to the current index or key for an iteration by something other than the special refs  @key  and  @index , you can also provide an alias for each of those. When aliasing key and index, only the first key alias is required, and it will always be the same as the index alias for an array because the key and index are the same thing. For an object iteration, the index alias will be the 0-based index of the key in the keys of the object being iterated.  {{#each people: index, key}}index and key are the same for an array{{/each}} !-- this works with a context alias as well -- \n{{#each people as person: index, key}}...{{/each}} !-- the second alias is not required -- \n{{#each people: i}}...{{/each}} !-- and it's only really useful when iterating an object -- \n{{#each someObject: k, i}}k is the current key and i is the current index{{/each}}  @index  and  @key  aliases are useful for nested  {{#each}}  blocks so that you have a way to refer to the outer key or index in any given iteration. It's also sometimes useful to give a more meaningful name to a key or index.  From 0.10.0  In addition to a context alias, you can also include aliases for  @keypath ,  @rootpath ,  @index , and  @key  instead of using the  : k, i  syntax. This tends to be slightly less confusing than trying to remember whether the first or second name is the key.  {{#each people as person, i as @index, path as @keypath}}...{{/each}} !-- the context alias is not required -- \n{{#each people, i as @index, path as @keypath}}...{{/each}}  There are also special aliases that can control the behavior of the  {{#each}}  block in special circumstances.  First, it's not possible to have a computed array shuffle (a keyed update, which moves iterated elements around the DOM to match new array positions rather than simply updating contents in place) because there's no way to tell the computation when an index is moved. With a plain old model, an  {{#each}}  block will automatically know how to shuffle itself if you use an array method like  splice  or a  set  with the  shuffle  option set. By setting the  shuffle  alias to either  true  or a keypath string to use to return an identity for each iteration, you can tell an  {{#each}}  with a computed array how to shuffle itself when the array changes.  true  will cause the identity of each element to be used to determine its new index, and a keypath will cause the identity of the value at that keypath from each element to determine its new index.  {{#each people, true as shuffle}}...{{/each}}\n{{#each people, 'profile.id' as shuffle}}...each person's profile id determines where they are in the list...{{/each}}  Second, computed contexts make two-way binding problematic, as updates don't propagate back to the source model automatically, or expensive, as using  syncComputedChildren  will invalidate everything involved with the computation any time the computed context is changed. The  source  alias of an  {{#each}}  block with a computed array can be set to have it map each of its iterations' contexts back to the plain model that is the basis of the computed array.  {{#each filter(people, { name: 'joe' }), people as source}}\n  {{@keypath}} will be something like `people.0` rather than a computed\n  keypath based on `filter(people, { name: 'joe' }).0`\n{{/each}}  The  as  in aliases is also optional, so  {{#each people person, @index i}}  is equivalent to  {{#each people as person, @index as i}} .",

To address that, yields may supply aliases that are made available to the yielded content:  const list = Ractive.extend({\n  template: `\n     ul \n      {{#each items}}\n         !-- Expose item and index to yield context. -- \n         li {{yield with . as item, @index as index}} /li \n      {{/each}}\n     /ul \n  `\n})\n\nconst ractive = Ractive({\n  el: 'body',\n  data: {\n    some: {\n      list: [ 1, 2, 3 ]\n    }\n  },\n  select(i) { console.log('you picked', i); },\n  template: `\n     !-- Pass in some.list as items into list. -- \n     list items= {{some.list}} \n\n       !-- Access item and index aliases. -- \n       a href= #  on-click= @.select(item) Item {{index}} /a \n     /list \n  `,\n  components: { list }\n})  Without the given alises, iterating a list within the component to yield the content would be useless, because the content would not have access to the current iteration. You could get around that by using a normal partial rather than a yield, but at that point, the click event on the content would result in an error because the  select  method does not exist on the  list  component.  Yield aliases are also available for named yields.  const Pager = Ractive.extend({\n  template: `\n     ul \n       li {{ yield prev }} /li \n      {{#each pages}}\n         li {{yield link with . as page}} /li \n      {{/each}}\n       li {{ yield next }} /li \n     /ul \n  `\n})\n\nconst ractive = Ractive({\n  components: { Pager },\n  el: 'body',\n  data: {\n    book: {\n      pages: [ 1, 2, 3 ]\n    }\n  },\n  template: `\n     Pager pages= {{ book.pages }} \n      {{#partial prev}} a href= #prev Prev /a {{/partial}}\n      {{#partial link}} a href= #{{ page }} {{ page }} /a {{/partial}}\n      {{#partial next}} a href= #next Next /a {{/partial}}\n     /Pager \n  `,\n})  From 0.10.0  You can also inject a context into a yield rather than aliases, in the same way that you can supply a context to a partial. When injecting a context, the container context will be accessible from the yielded template via the context parent prefix ( ^^/ ). The component context for the yield will still be the container.  const Loopy = Ractive.extend({\n  template: ` ul {{#each list}} li {{yield with .}} /li {{/each}} /ul `\n});\n\nconst ractive = new Ractive({\n  components: { Loopy },\n  target: 'body',\n  data: {\n    things: [ 1, 2, 3 ],\n    clicks: 0,\n    label: ' thing'\n  },\n  template: `{{clicks}} Loopy list= {{things}} button on-click= @.add('clicks') {{.}}{{^^/label}} /button /Loopy `\n});",

Where possible,  requestAnimationFrame  is used rather than  setTimeout .  Numeric values and strings that can be parsed as numeric values can be interpolated. Objects and arrays containing numeric values (or other objects and arrays which themselves contain numeric values, and so on recursively) are also interpolated.  Note that there is currently no mechanism for detecting cyclical structures! Animating to a value that indirectly references itself will cause an infinite loop.  Future versions of Ractive may include string interpolators - e.g. for SVG paths, colours, transformations and so on, a la D3 - and the ability to pass in your own interpolator.  If an animation is started on a keypath which is  already  being animated, the first animation is cancelled.

            "text": "Adaptors\n\n\nIn some cases you want to write your UI in Ractive but have a custom back-end manage the data. Adaptors allow you to teach Ractive how to talk to those custom data sources without having to change the way you write Ractive or having to write a lot of connector code up front.\n\n\nWriting\n\n\nAdaptors translate custom non-POJO (non-Plain Old JS Object) data sources into POJOs and vice-versa. Generally, an adaptor does the following:\n\n\n\n\nChecks if data needs to be adapted, and if so, \"wraps\" an adaptor to it.\n\n\nProvides a POJO version of your data source for Ractive to use.\n\n\nCaptures data changes on your data source and mirror them to the data in Ractive.\n\n\nCaptures data changes on the data in Ractive and mirror them to the data source.\n\n\n\n\nconst myAdaptor = {\n  filter ( value, keypath, ractive ) {\n    // return `true` if a particular object is of the type we want to adapt.\n  },\n  wrap ( ractive, value, keypath, prefixer ) {\n    // Setup\n    return {\n      get () {\n        // Returns POJO version of your data backend.\n      },\n      set (property, value) {\n        // Data setter for POJO property keypaths.\n      },\n      reset (value) {\n        // Data setter for POJO keypath.\n      },\n      teardown () {\n        // Code executed on teardown.\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nAn adaptor definition is an object with two methods:\n\n\n\n\nfilter\n: A function which, if it returns \ntrue\n, tells Ractive to use the adaptor on the value.\n\n\nvalue\n: The value to check.\n\n\nkeypath\n: The keypath of \nvalue\n relative to the instance root.\n\n\nractive\n: The instance where \nvalue\n resides.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nwrap\n: A function that sets up an adaptor.\n\n\nractive\n: The instance where \nvalue\n resides.\n\n\nvalue\n: The value to adapt.\n\n\nkeypath\n: The keypath of \nvalue\n relative to the instance root.\n\n\nprefixer\n: A function that accepts an object and returns a shallow clone with its keys prepended with \nkeypath\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nwrap\n function must return an object with four methods:\n\n\n\n\nget\n: A function that returns the POJO representation of the adapted data.\n\n\nset\n: A function that's called when the keypath being updated is a property of the adapted data.\n\n\nproperty\n: The property name to be updated.\n\n\nvalue\n: The new value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nreset\n: A function that's called when the keypath being updated is the adapted data itself. If \nreset\n returns \nfalse\n, Ractive will replace the data on the keypath with the POJO version, and tear down the adaptor.\n\n\nvalue\n: The new value\n\n\n\n\n\n\nteardown\n: A function that's called when an adaptor is being removed.\n\n\n\n\nAdaptors only adapt one level\n\n\nAn adaptor only adapts an object's immediate properties. Updating nested data via Ractive or via the data source will not update the other.\n\n\nNo built-in infinite loop detection\n\n\nThere is no built-in mechanism for avoiding infinite loops. If your adaptor calls \nractive.set()\n on adapted data, which in turn will call the adaptor's \nset()\n method, which may directly or indirectly trigger another \nractive.set()\n on the same adapted data, a stack overflow error might occur.\n\n\nThis isn't a problem with primitive values since Ractive doesn't bother calling \nset()\n if a value hasn't changed. But with objects and arrays, there's no easy and performant way to tell if the contents have changed. So \nset()\n gets called \nin case something changed\n rather than \nbecause something changed\n.\n\n\nDifferent for every back-end\n\n\nThe adaptor structure only provides you with the means to talk to and listen from a custom back-end. It does not impose any rules on how to write an adaptor for a certain back-end. For instance, an adaptor for a constructor-based object may be written differently from an adaptor meant to interact with a socket server.\n\n\nRegistering\n\n\nLike other plugins, there's 3 ways you can register adaptors:\n\n\nGlobally, via the \nRactive.adaptors\n static property.\n\n\nRactive.adaptors.myAdaptor = myAdaptor\n\n\n\n\nPer component, via the component's \nadaptors\n initialization property.\n\n\nconst MyComponent = Ractive.extend({\n  adaptors: { myAdaptor }\n})\n\n\n\n\nPer instance, via the instance's \nadaptors\n initialization property.\n\n\nconst ractive = Ractive({\n  adaptors: { myAdaptor }\n})\n\n\n\n\nUsing\n\n\nIn order to use an adaptor, you must tell the component or an instance to use it using the \nadapt\n initialization option.\n\n\nconst ractive = Ractive({\n  adapt: [ 'myAdaptor' ]\n})\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n\nIn the following example, we have a \nBox\n constructor that uses accessors to get and set its \nwidth\n and \nheight\n properties. Since an instance of \nBox\n will have no publicly visible properties, Ractive cannot bind to them directly.\n\n\nfunction Box(width, height) {\n  var _width = width\n  var _height = height\n\n  this.getWidth = () =\n { return _width; }\n  this.setWidth = (width) =\n { _width = width; }\n  this.getHeight = () =\n { return _height; }\n  this.setHeight = (height) =\n { _height = height }\n}\n\n\n\n\nIn order for Ractive to properly use a \nBox\n instance, we build an adaptor for \nBox\n.\n\n\nRactive.adaptors.boxAdaptor = {\n  filter ( object ) {\n    // Checks if the piece of data is an instance of Box.\n    return object instanceof Box\n  },\n  wrap ( ractive, box, keypath, prefixer ) {\n\n    // We keep a reference to the original functions before monkey-patching.\n    const setWidth = box.setWidth\n    const setHeight = box.setHeight\n\n    // Use ractive.set on the the adapted data whenever the setters are used.\n    box.setWidth = (width) =\n {\n      ractive.set(prefixer({\n        width: width\n      }))\n    }\n\n    box.setHeight = (height) =\n {\n      ractive.set(prefixer({\n        height: height\n      }))\n    }\n\n    return {\n      // Return a POJO representation of an instance of Box.\n      get () {\n        return {\n          width: box.getWidth(),\n          height: box.getHeight()\n        }\n      },\n      // Update the adapted object's properties\n      set (property, value) {\n        if(property === 'width') setWidth.call(box, value)\n        if(property === 'height') setHeight.call(box, value)\n      },\n      // Update the adapted object.\n      reset (data) {\n        // We don't adapt non-objects. And if the new data is an instance of Box\n        // there's a high chance that its a new instance. In either case, we\n        // need to tear down this adapter and have Ractive set it up again if\n        // necessary.\n        if(typeof data !== 'object' || data instanceof Box) return false\n\n        // Otherwise, we just parse through the data and update the existing box\n        // instance.\n        if(data.width !== undefined) setWidth.call(box, data.width)\n        if(data.height !== undefined) setHeight.call(box, data.height)\n      },\n      // Delete the monkey-patched methods.\n      teardown () {\n        delete box.setWidth\n        delete box.setHeight\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nThen we use \nboxAdaptor\n on an instance. The data can now be treated like regular Ractive data. Updates done directly on \nbox\n will reflect on Ractive. Any changes via Ractive will reflect on \nbox\n.\n\n\nconst ractive = Ractive({\n  el: 'body',\n  // Tell the instance we'll be using boxAdaptor\n  adapt: [ 'boxAdaptor' ],\n  // We write Ractive like normal.\n  template: `\n    \ndiv\nBox is {{ box.width }}x{{ box.height }}\n/div\n,\n    \ndiv\ninput type=\ntext\n value=\n{{ box.width }}\n/div\n\n    \ndiv\ninput type=\ntext\n value=\n{{ box.height }}\n/div\n\n  `\n})\n\nconst box = new Box(3, 4)\n\n// Set the Box instance as if it were a POJO.\nractive.set('box', box)\n\n// Both box instance and box object will have 7 width and 11 height and will\n// be rendered in the UI accordingly.\nbox.setWidth(7)\nractive.set('box.height', 11)\n\n\n\n\nComponents\n\n\nIn many situations, you want to encapsulate behaviour and markup into a single reusable \ncomponent\n, which can be dropped into Ractive applications. Components are simply custom-configured \"subclasses\" of Ractive (analogous, but technically incorrect).\n\n\nWriting\n\n\nThere are several ways to write Ractive components. Standard initialization options apply for configuration unless where changes are explicitly mentioned.\n\n\nThe most common way to define a component is by using \nRactive.extend()\n.\n\n\n// A subclass of Ractive\nconst MyComponent = Ractive.extend({\n  template: `\n    \ndiv class=\nmy-component\n\n      \nspan class=\nmy-component__message\n{{ message }}\n/span\n\n    \n/div\n\n  `,\n  css: `\n    .my-component__message { color: red }\n  `,\n  data: { message: 'Hello World' }\n})\n\n\n\n\nAnother way to define a component is by using component files and loaders.\n\n\ndiv class=\nmy-component\n\n  \nspan class=\nmy-component__message\n{{ message }}\n/span\n\n\n/div\n\n\n\nstyle\n\n  .my-component__message { color: red }\n\n/style\n\n\n\nscript\n\ncomponent.exports = {\n  data: { message: 'Hello World' }\n}\n\n/script\n\n\n\n\n\nRegistering\n\n\nLike other plugins, there's 3 ways you can register components:\n\n\nGlobally, via the \nRactive.components\n static property:\n\n\n// Available to all instances of Ractive.\nRactive.components.MyComponent = Ractive.extend({ ... })\n\n\n\n\nPer component, via the component's \ncomponents\n initialization property.\n\n\n// Only available for instances of AnotherComponent.\nconst AnotherComponent = Ractive.extend({\n  components: { MyComponent }\n})\n\n\n\n\nPer instance, via the instance's \ncomponents\n initialization property.\n\n\n// Only available to this specific instance.\nconst ractive = Ractive({\n  components: { MyComponent }\n})\n\n\n\n\nUsing\n\n\nComponents are simply subclasses of Ractive, which means they are also instatiable.\n\n\nconst ractive = MyComponent({ ... })\n\n\n\n\nBut where components really shine is when they're used on templates. They are written like \ncustom elements\n. Each custom element notation represents one instance of the component.\n\n\nconst AnotherComponent = Ractive.extend({\n  template: `\n    \ndiv\n\n      \nMyComponent /\n \n!-- One instance of MyComponent --\n\n      \nMyComponent /\n \n!-- Another instance of MyComponent --\n\n      \nMyComponent /\n \n!-- Yet another instance of MyComponent --\n\n    \n/div\n\n  `\n})\n\n\n\n\nThe component's tag name depends on the name used upon registration. The same component can be registered more than once using different names.\n\n\nconst MyComponent = Ractive.extend({...})\nRactive.components.MyComponent = MyComponent\nRactive.components.MyComponentOtherName = MyComponent\n\nconst AnotherComponent = Ractive.extend({\n  template: `\n    \ndiv\n\n      \nMyComponent /\n          \n!-- Using MyComponent --\n\n      \nMyComponentOtherName /\n \n!-- Using MyComponent's other name --\n\n    \n/div\n\n  `\n})\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n\n\n\n\nDecorators\n\n\nA decorator is a simple way to add behaviour to a node when it is rendered, or to augment it in some way. Decorators are a good way to integrate DOM manipulation libraries with Ractive, such as \njQuery UI\n or \nBootstrap\n.\n\n\nWriting\n\n\nconst myDecorator = (node[, ...args]) =\n {\n  // Setup code\n  return {\n    teardown () {\n      // Cleanup code\n    },\n    update ([...args]) {\n      // Update code\n    },\n    invalidate () {\n      // Code called on invalidate\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nDecorators are simply functions that are called upon to setup the decorator once Ractive detects its use. It takes a \nnode\n argument and returns an object with a \nteardown\n and \nupdate\n property.\n\n\nnode\n is the element to which the decorator is applied to.\n\n\n[args]\n are optional arguments provided by the decorator directive.\n\n\nteardown\n is a function that gets called when the decorator is torn down.\n\n\nupdate\n is an optional function that gets called when the arguments update.\n\n\ninvalidate\n, starting with 0.9.3, is an optional function that gets called when any bit of template downstream from the node is being updated.\n\n\nAny updates to the arguments will call the decorator's \nteardown\n and run the decorator function again, essentially setting up the decorator again. If an \nupdate\n function is provided on the return object, that will be called instead of the \nteardown\n and setup function.\n\n\nRegistering\n\n\nLike other plugins, there's 3 ways you can register decorators:\n\n\nGlobally, via the \nRactive.decorators\n static property.\n\n\nRactive.decorators.myDecorator = myDecorator\n\n\n\n\nPer component, via the component's \ndecorators\n initialization property.\n\n\nconst MyComponent = Ractive.extend({\n  decorators: { myDecorator }\n})\n\n\n\n\nPer instance, via the instance's \ndecorators\n initialization property.\n\n\nconst ractive = Ractive({\n  decorators: { myDecorator }\n})\n\n\n\n\nUsing\n\n\nOne or more decorators can be added to an element via the \nas-*\n directive. Arguments are passed to the decorator function by supplying comma-separated expressions as values. These expressions will become the second argument and onwards of the transition function.\n\n\n!-- without arguments --\n\n\ndiv as-myDecorator\n...\n/div\n\n\n\n!-- with arguments --\n\n\ndiv as-myDecorator=\narg1, .some.other.arg2, 10 * @index\n as-somethingElseToo\n...\n/div\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n\nThe following example builds a decorator that updates the time.\n\n\nRactive.decorators.timer = (node, time) =\n {\n  node.innerHTML = 'Hello World!'\n\n  return {\n    teardown () {\n      node.innerHTML = ''\n    },\n    update (time) {\n      node.innerHTML = time\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nconst ractive = Ractive({\n  el: 'body',\n  template: `\n    \nspan as-timer=\ntime\n/span\n\n  `,\n  data: {\n    time: 0\n  }\n})\n\nsetInterval(function () {\n  ractive.set('time', Date.now())\n}, 1000)\n\n\n\n\nEasings\n\n\nEasing functions describe the animation's progression from start to finish. Easings are used by \nractive.animate\n and some transitions. Out of the box, Ractive comes with \nlinear\n, \neaseIn\n, \neaseOut\n and \neaseInOut\n.\n\n\nWriting\n\n\nconst myEasing = ( t ) =\n {\n  // Calculation\n  return v\n}\n\n\n\n\nEasing functions receive \nt\n, a value from \n0\n to \n1\n, which represents the linear progression of the animation from start to finish. The easing function must then return \nv\n, a value also from \n0\n to \n1\n, which represents the progress of the animation for that easing.\n\n\nRegistering\n\n\nLike other plugins, there's 3 ways you can register an easing function:\n\n\nGlobally via the \nRactive.easing\n static property.\n\n\nRactive.easing.myEasing = myEasing\n\n\n\n\nPer component via the component's \neasing\n initialization property.\n\n\nconst MyComponent = Ractive.extend({\n  easing: { myEasing }\n})\n\n\n\n\nPer instance, via the instance's \neasing\n initialization property.\n\n\nconst ractive = Ractive({\n  easing: { myEasing }\n})\n\n\n\n\nUsing\n\n\nEasing functions are utilized by \nractive.animate()\n and transitions to define animations.\n\n\n\nractive.animate('counter', 60, {\n  easing: 'myEasing'\n})\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n\nHere's an \nelastic\n easing function taken from \ndanro\n's excellent \neasing.js\n library.\n\n\nRactive.easing.elastic = ( t ) =\n {\n  return -1 * Math.pow(4,-8*t) * Math.sin((t*6-1)*(2*Math.PI)/2) + 1\n}\n\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\nEvents allow custom-named events on DOM elements. Common use cases for custom DOM events include normalizing cross-browser events, normalizing cross-device events, implementing custom events, and so much more.\n\n\nWriting\n\n\nconst myEvent = (node, fire) =\n {\n  // Setup code\n  return {\n    teardown () {\n      // Cleanup code\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nEvents are simply functions that are called to set up the event on a DOM element. The event function accepts two arguments: \nnode\n and \nfire\n, and returns an object containing a \nteardown\n property.\n\n\nnode\n is the element to which the event is being applied.\n\n\nfire\n is the function that must be called when the event has taken place. \nfire\n takes a single argument, the event object received by handlers. The minimum requirement for the event object is a \nnode\n property that references DOM node the event is attached to, and an \noriginal\n property which references the native DOM \nevent\n object supplied by the native handler, if available.\n\n\nThe event object will be augmented with \ncontext\n, \nkeypath\n and \nindex\n properties, whose values depend on the data context the node is in. \ncontext\n references the data context that surrounds the node, \nkeypath\n is a string that leads to the current data context and \nindex\n is a number that references the index number of the data, should the data context be in an array.\n\n\nteardown\n is a function that gets called once the element is torn down. This allows the event to clean up after itself.\n\n\nRegistering\n\n\nLike other plugins, there's 3 ways you can register events:\n\n\nGlobally, via the \nRactive.events\n static property.\n\n\nRactive.events.myEvent = myEvent\n\n\n\n\nPer component, via the component's \nevents\n initialization property.\n\n\nconst MyComponent = Ractive.extend({\n  events: { myEvent }\n})\n\n\n\n\nPer instance, via the instance's \nevents\n initialization property.\n\n\nconst ractive = Ractive({\n  events: { myEvent }\n})\n\n\n\n\nUsing\n\n\nEvents use the same \non-*\n attribute syntax as component and DOM events. When Ractive encounters an \non-*\n attribute on a DOM element, it looks for a registered event and applies it on the element. If no matching event name was found, Ractive will think the event name is a native DOM event and will attach one accordingly.\n\n\n// This will apply the \nmyEvent\n custom event if one is registered.\n// Otherwise, Ractive will think it's a DOM event. You have been warned!\n\nspan on-myEvent=\nfoo()\nClick me!\n/span\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n\nHere's an example of a \"long press\" event which fires when the mouse is clicked and held for 1 second.\n\n\n// Definition\nRactive.events.longpress = (node, fire) =\n {\n  let timer = null\n\n  function clearTimer () {\n    if(timer) clearTimeout(timer)\n    timer = null\n  }\n\n  function mouseDownHandler(event) {\n    clearTimer()\n\n    timer = setTimeout(() =\n {\n      fire({\n        node: node,\n        original: event\n      })\n    }, 1000)\n  }\n\n  function mouseUpHandler () {\n    clearTimer()\n  }\n\n  node.addEventListener('mousedown', mouseDownHandler)\n  node.addEventListener('mouseup', mouseUpHandler)\n\n  return {\n    teardown () {\n      node.removeEventListener('mousedown', mouseDownHandler)\n      node.removeEventListener('mouseup', mouseUpHandler)\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n// Usage:\nRactive({\n  el: 'body',\n  template: `\n    \nbutton type=\nbutton\n on-longpress=\n@this.greetz()\nClick Me!\n/button\n\n  `,\n  greetz () {\n    console.log('Hello World!')\n  }\n})\n\n\n\n\nInterpolators\n\n\nInterpolator functions describe a value's progression during an animation from start to finish. Interpolator functions also determine the value on the model as well as what gets rendered during the animation.\n\n\nWriting\n\n\nconst myInterpolator = (from, to) =\n {\n\n  return t =\n {\n    return valueAtTimeT\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpolator plugins accept \nfrom\n and \nto\n. \nfrom\n is the value on the animated keypath before calling \nractive.animate()\n and \nto\n is the value being set by \nractive.animate()\n. The plugin must return a function that receives \nt\n and returns a value that represents the animated value at \nt\n. \nt\n is a value from \n0\n to \n1\n representing the animation's progress with easing already applied.\n\n\nRegistering\n\n\nLike other plugins, there's 3 ways you can register an interpolator function:\n\n\nGlobally via the \nRactive.interpolators\n static property.\n\n\nRactive.interpolators.myInterpolator = myInterpolator\n\n\n\n\nPer component via the component's \ninterpolators\n initialization property.\n\n\nconst MyComponent = Ractive.extend({\n  interpolators: { myInterpolator }\n})\n\n\n\n\nPer instance, via the instance's \ninterpolators\n initialization property.\n\n\nconst ractive = Ractive({\n  interpolators: { myInterpolator }\n})\n\n\n\n\nUsing\n\n\nInterpolator functions are utilized by \nractive.animate()\n by supplying the interpolator name to the \ninterpolator\n option.\n\n\nractive.animate('counter', 60, {\n  interpolator: 'myInterpolator'\n})\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n\nHere's an abridged version of Ractive's built-in \nnumber\n interpolator which interpolates numeric values (numbers and number-like strings) during animation.\n\n\nRactive.interpolators.number = (from, to) =\n {\n  const start = Number(from)\n  const end = Number(to)\n\n  if (Number.isNaN(start) || Number.isNaN(end)) return null\n\n  const delta = end - start\n  const noChangeInterpolator = () =\n start\n  const changeInterpolator = t =\n start + (t * delta)\n  return delta ? changeInterpolator : noChangeInterpolator\n}\n\n\n\n\nPartials\n\n\nA partial is a template snippet which can be reused in templates or in other partials. They help to keep templates uncluttered, non-repetetive and easy to read.\n\n\nWriting\n\n\nconst myPartial = '\n!-- template --\n'\n\n\n\n\nPartials are simply Ractive templates.\n\n\nRegistering\n\n\nUnlike other plugins, partials have more than 3 registration options.\n\n\nGlobally via the \nRactive.partials\n static property.\n\n\nRactive.partials.myPartial = MyPartial\n\n\n\n\nGlobally, via a non-executing script tag on the current page.\n\n\nscript type=\nractive/template\n id=\nmyPartial\n\n  ...\n\n/script\n\n\n\n\n\nPer component, via the component's \npartials\n initialization property.\n\n\nconst MyComponent = Ractive.extend({\n  partials: { myPartial }\n})\n\n\n\n\nPer instance, via the instance's \npartials\n initialization property.\n\n\nconst ractive = Ractive({\n  partials: { myPartial }\n})\n\n\n\n\nIn-template, using the \n{{#partial}}\n mustache.\n\n\n{{#partial myPartial}}\n  ...\n{{/}}\n\n\n\n\nUsing\n\n\nPartials can be used using \n{{\npartialName}}\n. Partials work where any template would work and takes on its surrounding context.\n\n\n{{#partial myPartial}}\n  \ndiv class=\nmessage\n{{message}}\n/div\n\n{{/partial}}\n\n\ndiv class=\napp\n\n  {{\nmyPartial}}\n\n/div\n\n\n\n\n\nValid names\n\n\nPartials may be named with the same rules as any other identifier in Ractive or JavaScript, but since there isn't much danger of trying to do math in a partial name, they enjoy relaxed naming requirements that allow otherwise reserved globals and keywords to be used for partial names.\n\n\nPartial names may also contain \n-\n and \n/\n characters as long as they are surrounded by other valid characters e.g. \ntemplates/some-partial-template\n.\n\n\nContext\n\n\nPartials be given an explicit context. Simply supply a reference to the context following the partial name on usage.\n\n\nRactive({\n  data: {\n    foo:{\n      bar: 'Hello, World!'\n    }\n  },\n  template: `\n    {{#partial myPartial}}{{bar}}{{/partial}}\n\n    {{\nmyPartial foo}}\n  `\n})\n\n\n\n\nAliases\n\n\nReferences can also be aliased in partials. Simply define aliases as comma-separated \nreference as alias\n pairs following the partial name on usage.\n\n\nRactive({\n  data: {\n    status: 'Me, Hungry!',\n    foo:{\n      bar: 'Hello, World!'\n    }\n  },\n  template: `\n    {{#partial myPartial}}{{msg}} {{state}}{{/partial}}\n\n    {{\nmyPartial foo.bar as msg, status as state}}\n  `\n})\n\n\n\n\nRecursive partials\n\n\nPartials can be used recursively. A common use case for this is when reusing partials on a tree-like structure, like a directory listing.\n\n\ndiv class='fileSystem'\n\n  {{#root}}\n    {{\nfolder}}\n  {{/root}}\n\n/div\n\n\n{{#partial folder}}\n\nul class='folder'\n\n  {{#files}}\n    {{\nfile}}\n  {{/files}}\n\n/ul\n\n{{/partial}}\n\n{{#partial file}}\n\nli class='file'\n\n  \nimg class='icon-{{type}}'\n\n  \nspan\n{{filename}}\n/span\n\n\n  \n!-- if this is actually a folder, embed the folder partial --\n\n  {{# type === 'folder' }}\n    {{\nfolder}}\n  {{/ type === 'folder' }}\n\n/li\n\n{{/partial}}\n\n\n\n\nrv = Ractive({\n  el: 'container',\n  template: '#myTemplate',\n  data: {\n    root: {\n      files: [\n        { type: 'jpg', filename: 'hello.jpg' },\n        { type: 'mp3', filename: 'NeverGonna.mp3' },\n        { type: 'folder', filename: 'subfolder', files: [\n          { type: 'txt', filename: 'README.txt' },\n          { type: 'folder', filename: 'rabbithole', files: [\n            { type: 'txt', filename: 'Inception.txt' }\n          ]}\n        ]}\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n})\n\n\n\n\nIn the example above, subfolders use the \n{{\nfolder}}\n partial, which uses the \n{{\nfile}}\n partial for each file, and if any of those files are folders, the \n{{\nfolder}}\n partial will be invoked again, and so on until there are no more files.\n\n\nBeware of cyclical data structures! Ractive makes no attempt to detect cyclicality, and will happily continue rendering partials until the \nBig Crunch\n (or your browser exceeds its maximum call stack size. Whichever is sooner).\n\n\nInjecting partials\n\n\nOne good use of partials is to vary the shape of a template according to some condition, the same way you might use \ndependency injection\n elsewhere in your code.\n\n\nFor example, you might offer a different view to mobile users:\n\n\ndiv class='main'\n\n  \ndiv class='content'\n\n    {{\ncontent}}\n  \n/div\n\n\n  \ndiv class='sidebar'\n\n    {{\nsidebar}}\n  \n/div\n\n\n/div\n\n\n\n\n\nisMobile = /mobile/i.test( navigator.userAgent ); // please don't do this in real life!\n\nractive = Ractive({\n  el: myContainer,\n  template: myTemplate,\n  partials: {\n    content: isMobile ? mobileContentPartial : desktopContentPartial,\n    sidebar: isMobile ? mobileSidebarPartial : desktopSidebarPartial\n  }\n})\n\n\n\n\nOr you might make it possible to extend a subclass without overriding its template:\n\n\ndiv class='modal-background'\n\n  \ndiv class='modal'\n\n    {{\nmodalContent}}\n  \n/div\n\n\n/div\n\n\n\n\n\n// Create a Modal subclass\nModal = Ractive.extend({\n  template: modalTemplate,\n  init () {\n    var self = this, resizeHandler\n\n    resizeHandler = () =\n {\n      self.center()\n    }\n\n    // when the window resizes, keep the modal horizontally and vertically centred\n    window.addEventListener( 'resize', resizeHandler )\n\n    // clean up after ourselves later\n    this.on( 'teardown', function () {\n      window.removeEventListener( 'resize', resizeHandler )\n    })\n\n    // manually call this.center() the first time\n    this.center()\n  },\n  center () {\n    // centering logic goes here\n  }\n})\n\nhelloModal = Modal({\n  el: document.body,\n  partials: {\n    modalContent: '\np\nHello!\n/p\na class=\nmodal-button\n proxy-tap=\nclose\nClose\n/a\n'\n  }\n})\n\nhelloModal.on( 'close', function () {\n  this.teardown()\n})\n\n\n\n\nPartial expressions\n\n\nExpressions can also be used to reference a partial instead of fixed partial names. Ractive will evaluate the expression and use its return value to select a partial. This is useful when you want the data to indicate what type of partial it should render with.\n\n\nIn the following example, \norganisms\n contains a list of organisms whose \ntype\n can either be \nperson\n or \nanimal\n. Partials for each type is defined and the list uses the \ntype\n of each item to determine which partial to use.\n\n\n{{#partial person}}Hi! I am {{.name}} and I have {{.fingerCount}} fingers!{{/}}\n\n{{#partial animal}}Hi! I am a {{.name}} and I have {{.legCount}} legs!{{/}}\n\n\nul\n\n  {{# organisms }}\n    \nli\n{{\n type }}\n/li\n\n  {{/}}\n\n/ul\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the case where there's a collision between the expression and a partial of the same name, Ractive will not evaluate the expression and instead, will immediately resolve to that partial.\n\n\nIn the following example, a partial named \ntype\n is defined. Instead of evaluating \ntype\n's value, it will resolve to the partial named \ntype\n.\n\n\n{{#partial person}}Hi! I am {{.name}} and I have {{.fingerCount}} fingers!{{/}}\n\n{{#partial animal}}Hi! I am a {{.name}} and I have {{.legCount}} legs!{{/}}\n\n{{#partial type}}Hi! I am {{.name}}{{/}}\n\n\nul\n\n  {{# organisms }}\n    \nli\n{{\n type }}\n/li\n\n  {{/}}\n\n/ul\n\n\n\n\n\nPartials can also be registered on-the-fly as well as have functions determine the partial to use.\n\n\nIn the following example, \nmakePartial\n registers a partial on the fly using \ntemplate\n and \nid\n, and returns the partial name for use in the template.\n\n\nRactive({\n  el: 'main',\n  template: `\n    \nspan\nAdd a partial:\n/span\n\n    \ntextarea value=\n{{tpl}}\n /\n/div\n\n    \nbutton on-click=\n@this.add()\nAdd\n/button\nbr/\n\n\n    {{#list}}\n      {{\n @this.makePartial(.id, .template) }}\n    {{/}}\n  `,\n  data: {\n    list: [],\n    tpl: '',\n\n  },\n  add () {\n    this.push('list', {\n      id: Math.random(),\n      template: this.get('tpl')\n    })\n    this.set('tpl', '')\n  },\n  makePartial (id, template) {\n    const name = 'partial-' + id\n    this.partials[name] = this.partials[name] || template\n    return name\n  }\n})\n\n\n\n\nUpdating Partials\n\n\nPartials may be reset after they are rendered using \nractive.resetPartial()\n. A reset partial will update everywhere it is referenced, so if it is used multiple times or inherited by a component, those instances will be updated as well. If a component has a partial with the same name as a parent partial, partial resets will not affect it since it is a different partial.\n\n\nIt should be noted that partials evaluate lazily, so it is possible to cause a single partial to update by wrapping it in a conditional section and causing the section to be hidden and re-shown.\n\n\n{{^toggle}}{{\nrickroll}}{{/}}\n\n\n\n\nractive.partials.rickroll = 'I wouldn\\'t do that to you, chum.'\nractive.set('toggle', true)\nractive.set('toggle', false)\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n\nHere's an example of a gallery using a partial for its thumbnail information:\n\n\n!-- The partial called \nthumbnail\n --\n\n\nfigure class='thumbnail'\n\n  \nimg src='assets/thumbnails/{{id}}.jpg'\n\n  \nfigcaption\n{{description}}\n/figcaption\n\n\n/figure\n\n\n\n!-- The template that uses the partial --\n\n\ndiv class='gallery'\n\n  {{#items}}\n    {{\nthumbnail}}\n  {{/items}}\n\n/div\n\n\n\n\n\nTransitions\n\n\nTransitions allow you to control how enter the DOM and how they leave the DOM. This allows you to define intro and outro behavior, particularly animations, when elements go in and out of the page.\n\n\nWriting\n\n\nconst myTransition = ( t[, ...args]] ) =\n {\n  // Manipulate the DOM.\n  // Call t.complete() when completed.\n}\n\n\n\n\nTransitions are simply functions that get called to animate a specified element.\n\n\nt\n is a transition helper object that aids in the implementation of the transition.\n\n\n[args]\n is the arguments passed in via the transition directive.\n\n\nTransitions are expected to be asynchronous. In order to signal Ractive that the transition has completed, the transition must call the \nt.complete()\n.\n\n\nNote that transitions control the element's arrival and departure to the page. That means upon completion, any styling done to the element will be removed automatically.\n\n\nRegistering\n\n\nLike other plugins, there's 3 ways you can register transitions:\n\n\nGlobally, via the \nRactive.transitions\n static property.\n\n\nRactive.transitions.myTransition = myTransition\n\n\n\n\nPer component, via the component's \ntransitions\n initialization property.\n\n\nconst MyComponent = Ractive.extend({\n  transitions: { myTransition }\n})\n\n\n\n\nPer instance, via the instance's \ntransitions\n initialization property.\n\n\nconst ractive = Ractive({\n  transitions: { myTransition }\n})\n\n\n\n\nUsing\n\n\nTransitions are added to an element via the \n*-in\n, \n*-out\n or \n*-in-out\n directives. The transition may be applied on element render (\n-in\n), on element removal (\n-out\n), or both (\n-in-out\n).\n\n\ndiv myTransition-in\nIntro-only\n/div\n\n\ndiv myTransition-out\nOutro-only\n/div\n\n\ndiv myTransition-in-out\nIntro and outro\n/div\n\n\n\n\n\nArguments are passed to the transition function by supplying comma-separated expressions as values to \n*-in\n, \n*-out\n or \n*-in-out\n. These expressions will become the second argument and onwards of the transition function.\n\n\ndiv myTransition-in-out=\n'Hello, World!', 42\nHello, World!\n/div\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples\n\n\nThe following example demonstrates a \"flash\" transition which colors the element green upon attachment, and red prior to removal.\n\n\nRactive.transitions.flash = (t, params) =\n {\n  // Process params and declaring defaults.\n  const options = t.processParams(params, {\n    color: t.isIntro ? '#0f0' : '#f00',\n    duration: 400\n  })\n\n  // The \ntransition\n\n  t.setStyle('color', options.color)\n\n  // Signal Ractive that the transition is complete.\n  setTimeout(t.complete, options.duration)\n}\n\nRactive({\n  el: 'body',\n  template: `\n    \nbutton on-click='@this.insert()'\nInsert item\n/button\n\n    \nbutton on-click='@this.remove()'\nRemove item\n/button\n\n    \nul\n\n      {{#items}}\n      \nli flash-in-out\n{{this}}\n/li\n\n      {{/items}}\n    \n/ul\n\n  `,\n  data: {\n    items: []\n  },\n  insert () {\n    this.push('items', Date.now())\n  },\n  remove () {\n    this.splice('items', 0, 1)\n  }\n})",

            "text": "Expressions can also be used to reference a partial instead of fixed partial names. Ractive will evaluate the expression and use its return value to select a partial. This is useful when you want the data to indicate what type of partial it should render with.  In the following example,  organisms  contains a list of organisms whose  type  can either be  person  or  animal . Partials for each type is defined and the list uses the  type  of each item to determine which partial to use.  {{#partial person}}Hi! I am {{.name}} and I have {{.fingerCount}} fingers!{{/}}\n\n{{#partial animal}}Hi! I am a {{.name}} and I have {{.legCount}} legs!{{/}} ul \n  {{# organisms }}\n     li {{  type }} /li \n  {{/}} /ul   In the case where there's a collision between the expression and a partial of the same name, Ractive will not evaluate the expression and instead, will immediately resolve to that partial.  In the following example, a partial named  type  is defined. Instead of evaluating  type 's value, it will resolve to the partial named  type .  {{#partial person}}Hi! I am {{.name}} and I have {{.fingerCount}} fingers!{{/}}\n\n{{#partial animal}}Hi! I am a {{.name}} and I have {{.legCount}} legs!{{/}}\n\n{{#partial type}}Hi! I am {{.name}}{{/}} ul \n  {{# organisms }}\n     li {{  type }} /li \n  {{/}} /ul   Partials can also be registered on-the-fly as well as have functions determine the partial to use.  In the following example,  makePartial  registers a partial on the fly using  template  and  id , and returns the partial name for use in the template.  Ractive({\n  el: 'main',\n  template: `\n     span Add a partial: /span \n     textarea value= {{tpl}}  / /div \n     button on-click= @this.add() Add /button br/ \n\n    {{#list}}\n      {{  @this.makePartial(.id, .template) }}\n    {{/}}\n  `,\n  data: {\n    list: [],\n    tpl: '',\n\n  },\n  add () {\n    this.push('list', {\n      id: Math.random(),\n      template: this.get('tpl')\n    })\n    this.set('tpl', '')\n  },\n  makePartial (id, template) {\n    const name = 'partial-' + id\n    this.partials[name] = this.partials[name] || template\n    return name\n  }\n})",

This document aims to give a breakdown of just what exactly each of these sections do.\n\n\nParser\n\n\nRactive's parser is reponsible for taking in Mustache-like/Handlebar-like templates. Unlike Mustache and Handlebars, however, it turns them into an \nAST\n for use by the runtime. In addition, it also supports a fair amount of ES syntax for use in expressions.\n\n\nEach item expressable in Ractive-flavored mustache has its own parsing function that may also be comprised of other parsing functions. Each bit of ES syntax that Ractive understands for expressions also has its own parsing function. The parser starts at the beginning of the template string and starts applying each parsing function in precedence order. Each function will then consume as much of the template as needed to return an item, like an element, a section, a partial, a bit of text, or an interpolator. It may also return nothing. Most items can also contain children, including items of the same type as themselves, and will thus recurse by trying to parse their content.\n\n\nMustaches\n\n\nEach type of mustache has its own reader that calls the appropriate expression or reference readers internally. For instance, the partial reader reads the current open mustache delimiter (defaults to \n{{\n) followed by a \n. It then expects to find a relaxed reference, meaning it may contain dashes and slashes among other usually-forbidden characters. It may then optionally read a context expression or series of alias definitions\n\n\nExpressions\n\n\nThe expression readers are set arranged such that they can read valid ES expressions with the correct operator precedence by starting with ternary conditionals and trying different expression types from there. Once the expression tree has been parsed, it is flattened into an expression string and a list of references that are used within that string. If the parsing is done with \ncsp\n (Content Security Policy) support enabled, then the expression strings are also turned into functions and attached to the output template structure so that the template can be used as-is from a script tag without \neval\ning.\n\n\nCleanup\n\n\nAfter all of the nodes have been parsed from the template, the template is cleaned up in a process that, among other things, merges adjacent text nodes and forms individual conditional sections out of \nelseif\n/\nelse\n trees.\n\n\nModels\n\n\nRactive wraps any data given to it into a tree-like hierarchy of \nModel\n. Any data that is rendered into a template will be bound to a \nModel\n. Access to read and write data in Ractive is handled through the model hierarchy based on keypaths, which are, generally, a list of object properties that one would need to follow to reach a leaf of the data tree starting from the root. Each key along the keypath has its own corresponding model.\n\n\nModels allow entities that depend upon them to register themeselves to receive change notifications when the model value changes. This is how Ractive keeps track of exactly which parts of the view need to be updated when values change.\n\n\nAll of the data managed by Ractive is represented by its model hierarchy.\n\n\nAlmost every type of Model is a subclass of \nModel\n, so it seems a good place to start. Each model typically has a parent model, a key that is used to access its value from its parent, and a value. Most models also have children of some sort, which are tracked by key such that \n{ foo: { bar: 'baz' } }\n would have a model with a \nchildByKey['foo']\n, which would also have a model at \nchildByKey['bar']\n. The value of each of the models listed there would be the object containing \nfoo: { bar:\nbaz\n}\n, its \nfoo\n child would be the object \nbar: 'baz'\n, and its \nbar\n child would be the string \n'baz'\n. Where children of a model are other models, dependents (\ndeps\n) of a model may be anything that wants to be notified of changes, and each model will typically have a number of dependents, too.\n\n\nEach model has a unique keypath that is assembled by taking its key and each of its parents keys up to the root and joining them with a \n.\n.\n\n\nModels are also inherently lazy, meaning their value is not necessarily available when the are created. A value is retrieved from a model using its \nget\n method which may have the side effect of computing the value. Once a value has been computed, it is generally cached until a change happens that would cause the cache to be invalidated. In most models, there isn't really an opportunity for that change outside of normal change propagation.\n\n\nRootModel\n\n\nEvery tree needs a root, and \nRootModel\n serves that purpose here. Each Ractive instance gets its own \nRootModel\n that is stored at its \nviewmodel\n property. This special model is also the storage point for computations and mappings.\n\n\nKeyModel\n\n\nThe last major model remaining is the \nKeyModel\n. Instances of this represent indices of arrays and keys of objects during iteration. The key flavor never is immutable, becuase the keys of  objects never change (they may be removed, but that doesn't change the key itself). The index flavor \ndoes\n change, but only when the array represented by its parent model is shuffled.\n\n\nOther models\n\n\nThere are a few other types of \nModel\n in the code, such as the \nRactiveModel\n, which represents a Ractive instance, and the \nGlobalModel\n, which represents the global object of the current environment a.k.a. \nwindow\n for browsers and \nglobal\n for Node.js.\n\n\nModel operations\n\n\nChange propagation\n\n\nWhen a change is supplied to a model, its \nset\n method is called, which usually delegates to \napplyValue\n. \napplyValue\n checks to see that the value has actually changed in some way (hint: setting to the same object or array is considered a change because something may have changed further in), and if it has, it will start change notification for all of the model's children and dependents. If the model has resolvers registered with it trying to get an unresolved value, then this is where the unresolved value will be resolved and the resolver satisfied and cleared. Next, any children will be notified that their parent has had a value change and that they may need to update accordingly, which may trigger further cascades of resolution and change notification. Next, any dependents of the model will be notified that the model has had a value change as their \nhandleChange\n methods are called. Finally, upstream models (parents) are notified that a change has taken place somewhere among its children.\n\n\nThe child notification of the propagation is handled by the model's \nmark\n method. \nmark\n also checks to see that the value has actually changed, and if it has, will notify its children and dependents that it has had a value change. This is also the method called when the user signals that they have changed some data externally by calling \nractive.update()\n.\n\n\nShuffling\n\n\nThere is a special form of change wherein an array is modified without being swapped out, which is triggered by array methods like \nsplice\n, \npush\n, and \npop\n. When an array modification happens, change propagation takes a special path through the model that allows more precise DOM manipulation rather than throwing all of the DOM out and replacing it with a new result. This is achieved by having the special array method handlers compute which indexes are actually changed and having the array model's deps that can actally handle a shuffle ignore any untouched indices.\n\n\nThe instance method \nmerge\n does something similar, but instead of modifying the underlying array, it compares the members of the new supplied array against the model array to compute the index changes. It the swaps in the new array and triggers a shuffle based on the computed index changes.\n\n\nAdaptation\n\n\nBetween the change check and the change propagation during \napplyValue\n, there is a step that handles part of adaptation so that external objects with special behaviors, like backbone models, can be used as data sources. An adaptors takes the special object, wraps it up, and returns the wrapper that also has a value that represents the object for consumption by Ractive. Most adaptors also have methods to update values in their source data as well, and those methods are called when an update is applied to an adapted model.\n\n\nComputations\n\n\nA computation is exactly what is sounds like: a getter and optional setter function that are used to provide read and optional write access to some non-fixed piece of data. Each computation is stored in the root model \ncomputations\n hash by its keypath. Computations can be created in two places:\n\n\n\n\nExplicitly when a \ncomputed\n map is passed to a Ractive instantiation or when an entry is later added to a instance's computed map. These may be read/write and have a keypath that mirrors their name.\n\n\nImplicitly when an expression is used in a template. These are read-only and have a keypath that is an expanded representation of their expression.\n\n\n\n\nA computation is also a form of model, so anything that depends on it will subscribe to it as if it were a regular model. Change propagation happens in the same way as a regular model as well.\n\n\nSince computations may depend on other bits of data controlled by Ractive, while they are being retrieved, any references to other models will cause the extra references to be \ncapture\nd. When the computation is complete, the computation will register with each of its captured dependencies so that it will be notified when it needs to invalidate and notify its dependents of the change.\n\n\nMappings\n\n\nWhen a Ractive instance has children, typically components, it may supply a handles to its own data to them in the form of mappings. The child instance stores a reference to the parent model at its mapped name and uses it when its dependents request access to keypaths that start with the mapped name. This allows child instances, which may be isolated, to stay in sync with portions of their parents data easily, because the parent still controls the data (single source of truth) and there is no syncing involved. So if a parent has a component \nComponent foo=\"{{bar.baz.bat.bippy}}\" /\n, then the component instance will get a mapping \nfoo\n that references the parent model at \nbar.baz.bat.bippy\n.\n\n\nVirtual DOM\n\n\nEvery piece of DOM that Ractive can manage has a corresponding class in the virtual DOM to handle the DOM node, which generally end up being either Elements or Text Nodes. View items are grouped together as Fragments of view, which may then be owned by other fragments or items. At the root of every ractive instance is a Fragment instance that contains its entire virtual DOM tree. Each Ractive template construct has at least one analog in the virtual DOM. The bulk of Ractive's view functionality is implemented in the Section, Interpolator, and Element items, with there being a number of specialized element classes to handle special types of HTML element.\n\n\nAll virtual DOM items go through roughly the same lifecycle: creation, binding, rendering, bubbling, updating, unrendering, and unbinding. Creation is basically just the constructor call and almost always is immediately followed by binding. Binding is the point at which the item resolves and registers with its data references. Rendering is the point at which the item inserts an actual DOM node into the DOM. Bubbling and updating are the two halves of the update process, which is discussed in the next section. Unrendering is the point at which the item should no longer be present in the DOM, and it often occurs at the same point as unbinding, which is the point at which the item unregisters with the viewmodel and is effectively destroyed.\n\n\nThere a number of other members, such as events and decorators, and processes, such as change propagation, which are described in detail in the view overview.\n\n\nRactive views are structured virtual DOM trees that are assembled from template AST and manage DOM nodes on the page when they are rendered. Virtual DOM items are grouped together in \nFragment\ns, which contain them, and they may also own \nFragment\ns that contain other items. Each item may contain a reference to a DOM node when rendered, though every item doesn not have a DOM analog.\n\n\nParallel DOM\n\n\nRactive works by maintaining a simplified model of the part of the DOM that it's responsible for. This model contains all the information - about data-binding, event handling and so on - that it needs to keep things up-to-date.\n\n\nYou can inspect the parallel DOM to understand what's going on under the hood, if you're into that sort of thing. Each Ractive instance, once rendered, has a \nfragment\n property. Each fragment has a number of properties:\n\n\n\n\ncontextStack\n - the context stack in which mustache references should be evaluated\n\n\nroot\n - a reference to the Ractive instance to which it belongs\n\n\nowner\n - the \nitem\n that owns this fragment (in the case of the root fragment, the same as \nroot\n)\n\n\nitems\n - the items belonging to this fragment\n\n\n\n\nItems\n means elements, text nodes, and mustaches. Elements may have fragments of their own (i.e. if they have children). A partial mustache will have a fragment, and a section mustache will have zero or more fragments depending on the value of its keypath.\n\n\nElements may also have attributes, which have a different kind of fragment (a \ntext fragment\n as opposed to a \nDOM fragment\n), containing text and mustaches.\n\n\nEach item has a \ndescriptor\n, which is something like DNA. This comes straight from the parsed template.\n\n\nThis is the briefest of overviews - if you want to gain a deeper understanding of what's going on under the hood, \nuse the source\n.\n\n\nStates\n\n\nItems generally follow a fixed lifecycle.\n\n\n\n\nConstruction - the item is created and knows about its parent and the template chunk from which it was created. Its template may also indicate what its children should look like if it has them.\n\n\nbind\n - the item looks up any references is may have and registers with the model(s) that they represent. At this point, the item may create child items and bind them as well.\n\n\nrender\n - the item may create an actual DOM node and tell its children to create their DOM nodes as necessary. The resulting nodes will be inserted into the document.\n\n\nunrender\n - thie item is no longer needed and will be removed from the document immediately or in the near future.\n\n\nunbind\n - this typically goes along with \nunrender\n and tells the models on which this item depends that they should no longer send change notifications to it.\n\n\n\n\nThere is a sixth floating step \nrebind\n that happens any time one dependency models shuffles (and in certain other very special circumstances) that causes the items to re-resolve their models and re-register if necessary.\n\n\nVirtual DOM Items\n\n\nText\n\n\nText is the simplest item. It simply holds a string that it turns into a \nTextNode\n when rendered.\n\n\nInterpolator\n\n\nThis is the next simplest item. It resolves a model for its reference or expression and renders the value of the model as a text node if needed. Interpolators don't necessarily render directly, as they may be used for values by other items, such as attributes, mappings, and bindings.\n\n\nElement\n\n\nAn \nElement\n represents a DOM element. It also contains a number of other items in the form of \nAttribute\ns, \nDecorator\ns, \nTransition\ns, \nEventDirective\ns, and its children in a \nFragment\n.\n\n\nAttributes\n\n\nThere are actually several different items that are treated as attributes for \nElement\ns, event though only two of them actually may render into the DOM.\n\n\n\n\nAttribute\ns - maybe obvious, they these represent a DOM attribute on their parent element. There are a number of different handlers for updating attributes depending on the element and attribute name. The \nupdateDelegate\n for a particular attribute can be found in \ngetUpdateDelegate.js\n.\n\n\nConditionalAttribute\ns - render as a string and are parsed into actual DOM attributes using a \ndiv\n or an \nsvg\n depending on their parent element.\n\n\nMapping\ns - when rendered add a mapping to their component, and when unrendered, remove it. These aren't attached to \nElement\ns, but instead, are attached to \nComponent\ns (see below).\n\n\nEventDirective\ns - when rendered attach an event listener to their parent, and when unrenedered, remove it. Event parameters are kept in sync with their bindings and are evaluated when the event fires.\n\n\nBindingDirective\ns - when rendered and unrendered update their parent element's bindings, if they exist.\n\n\nDecorator\ns - when rendered call the named decorator with their parent element, and when unrenedered, remove it. \nDecorator\ns also have an update cycle related to their parameters.\n\n\nTransition\ns - are a sort of weird case. When rendered, they attach a transition handler to their element, and when the element renders or unrenders, if an appropriate transition handler is registered, will trigger the transition. Transition parameters are also kept in sync with their bindings.\n\n\n\n\nBindings\n\n\nCertain attributes may also trigger a binding to be created on their parent element. For instance, if two-way binding is enabled on the parent element, and the parent element is an \ninput\n, a \nvalue\n attribute with a single \nInterpolator\n as its content will cause a two-way binding to be created between the value of the \ninput\n and the model of the \nInterpolator\n. This binding will handle updating the model when the input \nvalue\n has changed. There are a few other types of bindings for managing check values, content editables, name-bound lists of checkboxes, and other miscellaneous special values.\n\n\nA \nlazy\n binding directive will cause any associated two-way bindings to fire either after a timeout or on blur, depending on the value of the \nlazy\n directive.\n\n\nSection\n\n\nSection\ns come in many flavors, depending on the chunk of template from which they are created. A section may provide context, be conditional (positive or negative), or be iterative. Generic sections (\n{{#something}}...{{/}}\n in template) will adjust their type, to a certain extent, based on the value of their model. A generic section will always provide context in the form of their model. An \nif\n-style conditional section, including \nelseif\n, \nelse\n, and \nunless\n do not provide context. An \neach\n section will always provide context in the form of the current iteration. A \nwith\n section will always provide context as its model, but it will only render if its model is considered truthy by Ractive, which is pretty much the same as JS truthy except \n{}\n and \n[]\n are falsey. A generic section will be context/conditional if it is anything other than an array, which will make it iterative.\n\n\nSections that provide context do so by binding their \nFragment\ns with their model so that the reference resolution process can find the appropriate contexts when resolving.\n\n\nContext/Conditional\n\n\nContext and conditional sections will render and unrender their child fragment as their model changes truthiness. Conditional sections always stand alone, even it they have \nelseif\n or \nelse\n branches nested within them, because those branches are turned into independent sections during parsing.\n\n\nIterative\n\n\nIf section is designated iterative (\n{{#each ...}}\n) or is a general section with an array value resolution, the section will create a special form of fragment for each index or key in the value. The special form \nRepeatedFragment\n handles mapping of indices, keys, and references to those to a corresponding model. Iterative sections also have special handling for shuffles so that DOM is not wholesale destroyed and recreated when the array shuffles.\n\n\nIterative sections may supply an alias for their context, so that referencing the iterated value is a little bit easier. See \nAliases\n below for more info, as this is just a slightly specialized form of that.\n\n\nIterative sections may also supply key and/or index aliases so that their keys and/or indices may be referenced by a name from within their child fragments.\n\n\nAlias\n\n\nAlias sections simply resolve their models and act as a lookup endpoint for reference resolution. Aliasing happens entirely in the view.\n\n\nComponent\n\n\nA component is a sort-of special form of \nElement\n that, instead of creating a DOM element, creates a new Ractive instance. The child instance will be rendered and unrendered in place of the component placeholder in the DOM.\n\n\nAny plain \nAttribute\ns with a single \nInterpolator\n as content in a component's template are turned into \nMapping\ns.\n\n\nThe resolution process no longer happens strictly within the vDOM, as the result of \nRactive.getContext\n also uses the target \nElement\n's fragment to resolve relative references. Event objects are also extended with methods from the same helper.\n\n\nUpdates\n\n\nThe \nrunloop\n controls when the DOM is actually updated and when transitions start in \nbatch\nes. It also handles resolving promises when transitions have completed and the DOM is completely up to date.\n\n\nAs changes propagate through the viewmodel, view items are notified of the change through their \nhandleChange\n method. Most items just set a dirty flag and notify their parent, via their \nbubble\n method, that they will need to be updated at the completion of the runloop turn. The root fragment of each instance affected will then register with the runloop. Once the changes are ready to be flushed to the view, each fragment registered with the runloop is called on to update, where the process happens in reverse, with each parent fragment checking to see if there is a change it needs to respond to and propagating the update downward to its children.\n\n\nData management\n\n\nDependents\n\n\nRactive maintains a dependency graph in order to do only the minimum amount of work necessary to keep the DOM up-to-date. If you inspect a Ractive instance, you'll see a property called \n_deps\n. This is where all dependants are listed, indexed by their dependency.\n\n\nExpression dependencies\n\n\nRactive uses dynamic analysis to determine dependencies. Depedendencies are determined by capturing references in the viewmodel while the function is executing. Dependencies for functions are re-captured each time the function is executed.\n\n\np\n{{ formattedName() }}\n/p\n\n\n\n\n\nvar ractive = Ractive({\n  template: template,\n  el: output,\n  data: {\n    user: { firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Public' },\n    formattedName () {\n      return this.get('user.lastName') + ', ' + this.get('user.firstName')\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\nResult:\n\n\np\nPublic, John\n/p\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this example, the function \nformattedName\n will depend on both \nuser.firstName\n and \nuser.lastName\n, and updating either (or \nuser\n) will cause any expressions referencing \nformattedName\n to be re-evaluated as well.\n\n\nractive.set('user.firstName', 'Jane')\n\n\n\n\nResult:\n\n\np\nPublic, Jane\n/p\n\n\n\n\n\nPriority\n\n\nRactive runs updates based on priority. For instance, when a subtree of the DOM needs to be removed while at the same time updates are pending for that subtree. What Ractive does is prioritize the removal of the subtree over the updates. This causes the dependents on the subtree to unregister themselves, eliminating the need to update, resulting with only the removal operation being done.\n\n\nIndirect dependencies\n\n\nIf you have a mustache which depends on \nfoo.bar\n, and \nfoo\n changes, it's quite possible that the mustache needs to re-render. We say that the mustache has an \nindirect dependency\n on \nfoo\n, or that it has a \ndirect dependency on a downstream keypath\n of \nfoo\n.\n\n\nThis relationship is expressed through the \n_depsMap\n property of a Ractive instance - whenever \nfoo\n changes, as well as dealing with direct \nfoo\n dependants we check the map for those indirect dependants.\n\n\nIn the case of expressions and observers, we also need to consider dependants of \nupstream keypaths\n. For example, suppose we have a section based on a sorted array - if we modify one of the members of the array, we need to see if the sort order has changed or not as a result:\n\n\n{{#( sort( list, 'name' ) )}}\n  \np\n{{name}}\n/p\n\n{{/()}}\n\n\n\n\nractive = Ractive({\n  el: myContainer,\n  template: myTemplate,\n  data: {\n    list: [{ name: 'Bob' }, { name: 'Charles' }, { name: 'Alice' }],\n    sort ( list, property ) {\n      return list.slice().sort( function ( a, b ) {\n        return a[ property ] \n b[ property ] ? -1 : 1\n      })\n    }\n  }\n})\n\n// renders Alice, Bob, Charles\n\nractive.set( 'list[0].name', 'Zebediah' )\n\n// updates to Alice, Charles, Zebediah\n\n\n\n\nIn the example, setting \nlist[0].name\n causes dependants of \nlist\n to be updated.\n\n\nAs well as expressions, Observers respond to both upstream and downstream changes.\n\n\nExpressions with multiple dependencies\n\n\nThe expression \n{{ a + b }}\n has two dependencies - \na\n and \nb\n (or more accurately, whatever those references resolve to). The \n_deps\n graph actually includes objects representing those individual references, rather than the expression itself - the reference objects then notify the expression (if their value has changed) that it will need to re-evaluate itself.\n\n\nBecause the expression has multiple dependencies, it won't trigger an update straight away - it will wait until all the new data has come in first. So doing \nractive.set({ a: 1, b: 2 })\n will only trigger one update, not two.\n\n\nTwo-way binding\n\n\nTwo-way binding allows data to update bi-directionally, from data to the UI and vice versa.\n\n\n\n\n\nRactive({\n  data: {\n    msg: 'Hello, World!'\n  },\n  template: `\n    \ninput type=\ntext\n value=\n{{ msg }}\n {{ msg }}\n\n    \nbutton on-click=\n@this.set('msg', 'Lorem Ipsum')\nTo lipsum\n/button\n\n  `\n})\n\n\n\n\nTwo-way binding can be disabled via the \ntwoway\n initialization option or the \ntwoway\n input directive.\n\n\nAmbiguous references\n\n\nAn ambiguous reference refers to a reference whose data does not exist at the time of construction. Ractive must make an assumption, following a resolution algorithm, on what ambiguous references resolve to. Until a suitable keypath pops into existence, ambiguous references resolve to \nundefined\n.\n\n\n\n\n\nRactive({\n  data: {},\n  template: `\n    \ninput value=\n{{ msg }}\n {{ msg }}\n  `,\n})\n\n\n\n\nAmbiguous references can be locked to a specific keypath, skipping the whole resolution process, using keypath prefixes.\n\n\nLazy updates\n\n\nBy default, Ractive uses various events (i.e. \nchange\n, \nclick\n, \ninput\n, \nkeypress\n) to listen for changes on interactive elements and immediately update bound data. In cases where data updates should only take place after the element loses focus, Ractive also supports lazy updating.\n\n\n\n\n\nRactive({\n  lazy: true,\n  data: {\n    msg: ''\n  },\n  template: `\n    \ndiv\nType and click outside the input\n/div\n\n    \ninput type=\ntext\n value=\n{{ msg }}\n {{ msg }}\n  `\n})\n\n\n\n\nLazy updates can be enabled via the \nlazy\n initialization option or the \nlazy\n directive.\n\n\nComputed Properties\n\n\nComputed properties are top-level pseudo-data references whose value is defined by a computation and which automatically update when its dependencies update.\n\n\nFunction syntax\n\n\nThe function syntax defines a computed property as a function that returns the computed value. The context of the function is the current instance.\n\n\n\n\n\nRactive({\n  data: {\n    width: 200,\n    length: 300\n  },\n  computed: {\n    area () {\n      return this.get('width') * this.get('length')\n    }\n  },\n  template: `\n    Width: \ninput type=\ntext\n value=\n{{ width }}\n\n    Length: \ninput type=\ntext\n value=\n{{ length }}\n\n    Area: {{ area }}\n  `\n})\n\n\n\n\nExpression syntax\n\n\nThe expression syntax defines a computed property as a string containing a JavaScript expression. \n${}\n is replaced internally with a \nractive.get()\n, using its contents as a keypath.\n\n\n\n\n\nRactive({\n  data: {\n    width: 200,\n    length: 300\n  },\n  computed: {\n    area: '${width} * ${length}'\n  },\n  template: `\n    Width: \ninput type=\ntext\n value=\n{{ width }}\n\n    Length: \ninput type=\ntext\n value=\n{{ length }}\n\n    Area: {{ area }}\n  `\n})\n\n\n\n\nAccessor syntax\n\n\nBoth function and expression syntaxes only describe retrieval of the computed property's value, and therefore makes the computed property read-only. The accessor syntax defines a computed property by providing \nget\n and \nset\n methods. \nget\n is called to retrieve its value and \nset\n is called when something updates its value.\n\n\n\n\n\nRactive({\n  data: {\n    side: 200\n  },\n  computed: {\n    area: {\n      get () {\n        return Math.pow(this.get('side'), 2)\n      },\n      set(v) {\n        this.set('side', Math.sqrt(v))\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  template: `\n    Side: \ninput type=\ntext\n value=\n{{ side }}\n\n    Area: \ninput type=\ntext\n value=\n{{ area }}\n\n  `\n})\n\n\n\n\nBoth function and expression syntaxes are supported for the \nget\n method.\n\n\nObservers\n\n\nNested properties\n\n\nObservers observe \nupstream\n and \ndownstream\n keypaths. This allows observers to execute when data is updated indirectly, whether if it's the enclosing structure or a descendant structure.\n\n\n\n\n\nconst instance = Ractive({\n  data: {\n    foo: {\n      bar: 1\n    }\n  },\n  observe: {\n    'foo' (newValue) {\n      console.log('foo changed to', newValue)\n    },\n    'foo.bar' (newValue) {\n      console.log('foo.bar changed to', newValue)\n    }\n  }\n})\n\ninstance.set('foo.bar', 2)\ninstance.set('foo', { bar: 3 })\n\n\n\n\nObservers can be set to only execute on the specified keypath via the \nstrict\n option for both \nobserve\n initialization option and \nractive.observe()\n.\n\n\nWildcards\n\n\nWildcards allow observers to observe keypaths whose segments cannot be determined in advance. This is useful when observing an array, observing items within an array, or observing changes on object properties.\n\n\n\n\n\nconst instance = Ractive({\n  data: {\n    people: [\n      {name: 'Rich Harris'},\n      {name: 'Marty Nelson'}\n    ],\n    config: {\n      allowComments: true,\n      allowEdit: false\n    }\n  },\n  observe: {\n    // Observe changes on the array\n    'people.*' () {\n      console.log('array observer', arguments)\n    },\n    // Observe changes on the name property of any item in the array\n    'people.*.name' () {\n      console.log('array item observer', arguments)\n    },\n    // Observe changes on any property of an object\n    'config.*' () {\n      console.log('object property observer', arguments)\n    }\n  }\n})\n\ninstance.push('people', {name: 'Jason Brown'})\ninstance.set('people.3', {name: 'Jack Black'})\ninstance.set('config.allowEdit', true)\n\n\n\n\nMultiple sources\n\n\nMultiple keypaths can be observed by adding them one after the other, separating them with a space.\n\n\n\n\n\nconst instance = Ractive({\n  data: {\n    user: {username: 'browniefed'},\n    config: {isAdmin: false},\n    commentCount: 0\n  },\n  observe: {\n    'user.username config.isAdmin commentCount' () {\n      console.log('data changed', arguments)\n    }\n  }\n})\n\ninstance.set('user.username', 'chris')\ninstance.set('config.isAdmin', true)\ninstance.set('commentCount', 42)\n\n\n\n\nCaveats\n\n\nObservers do not defensively clone the old and new values as identity of these values may be essential. Thus, observers on non-primitive values may result in having identically equal old and new values.\n\n\n\n\n\nconst instance = Ractive({\n  data: {\n    config: {\n      allowComments: true,\n      allowEdit: false\n    }\n  },\n  observe: {\n    'config' (newValue, oldValue) {\n      console.log(newValue === oldValue)\n    }\n  }\n})\n\ninstance.set('config.allowEdit', true)\n\n\n\n\nBoth \nobserve\n initialization option and \nractive.observe()\n accept an \nold\n option which allows you to define the old value passed to the observer prior to modifications.\n\n\nComponents\n\n\nMappings\n\n\nMappings connect pieces of data on the enclosing instance to data on enclosed instances. Changes on one side will reflect on the other.\n\n\nRactive.components.MyComponent = Ractive.extend({\n  data: {\n    message: ''\n  },\n  template: `\n    \ninput type=\ntext\n value=\n{{ message }}\n\n  `\n})\n\nconst instance = Ractive({\n  el: 'body',\n  data: {\n    text: ''\n  },\n  template: `\n    \nMyComponent message=\n{{ text }} /\n\n  `\n})\n\nractive.set('text', 'Hello World!')\n\n\n\n\nIn the example above, \ntext\n on the instance is mapped to \nMyComponent\n's \nmessage\n. Updates on \ntext\n will update \nmessage\n and any UI elements bound to it. Updates on \nmessage\n, like editing the \ninput\n bound with it, will update \ntext\n.\n\n\nData context\n\n\nEach component instance comes with its own data context so that its data does not pollute the primary data. Any mapping between the component and the enclosing instance will still update across both contexts.\n\n\nRactive.components.MyComponent = Ractive.extend({\n  data: {\n    shades: '',\n    option: ''\n  }\n})\n\nconst instance = Ractive({\n  template: `\n    \nMyComponent shades='{{colors}}' option='A' /\n\n  `,\n  data: {\n    name: 'Colors',\n    colors: ['red', 'blue', 'yellow']\n  }\n})\n\nconst widget = ractive.findComponent('MyComponent')\n\nractive.get() // {\ncolors\n:[\nred\n,\nblue\n,\nyellow\n], \nname\n:\nColors\n}\nwidget.get()  // {\nshades\n:[\nred\n,\nblue\n,\nyellow\n], \noption\n:\nA\n}\n\nractive.set('colors.1', 'green')\n\nractive.get() // {\ncolors\n:[\nred\n,\ngreen\n,\nyellow\n], \nname\n:\nColors\n}\nwidget.get()  // {\nshades\n:[\nred\n,\ngreen\n,\nyellow\n], \noption\n:\nA\n}\n\n\n\n\nIn the example above, the enclosing instance data holds \nname\n and \ncolors\n. \ncolors\n is mapped to \nshades\n and \noption\n is set on an instance of \nMyComponent\n. Upon inspection, \nname\n from the enclosing instance does not cross over to \nMyComponent\n nor does \noption\n cross over to the enclosing instance. However, since \ncolors\n on the instance is mapped to \nshades\n on the component, any modifications on either side will reflect on the other.\n\n\nIsolation\n\n\nBy default, components are \"isolated\". Descendant components can update ancestor data only when there is an explicit mapping between them. This avoids unintended mutation of ancestor data and ensures portability of components.\n\n\nRactive.components.ChildComponent = Ractive.extend({\n  template: 'Message missing {{ message }}'\n})\n\nconst instance = Ractive({\n  el: 'body',\n  template: '\nChildComponent /\n',\n  data: {\n    message: 'The ChildComponent will not know anything about this message'\n  }\n})\n\n\n\n\nIn the example above, \nChildComponent\n will not print anything since \nmessage\n is not defined in the component and due to isolation, the component cannot see the instance's \nmessage\n.\n\n\nIsolation can be disabled via the \nisolated\n initialization option.\n\n\nEvent Management\n\n\nLike many other libraries, Ractive implements its own \npublish/subscribe\n mechanism for triggering and responding to particular events. One of the advantages of using Ractive-managed events is that events are automatically unsubscribed and unreferenced once the instance is torn down, avoiding the need to do manual housekeeping.\n\n\nSources\n\n\nEvent API\n\n\nEvents that are published as a result of using the event APIs directly (i.e. \nractive.fire\n). Most of the other event sources use the event APIs to publish events at some point in their operation.\n\n\ninstance.fire('someevent', 'Hello, World!')\n\n\n\n\nLifecycle events\n\n\nLifecycle events are events that are published by an instance during the different phases of its existence. Ractive instances publish the following lifecycle events:\n\n\n\n\nconstruct\n\n\nconfig\n\n\ninit\n\n\nrender\n\n\ncomplete\n\n\nupdate\n\n\ninsert\n\n\ndetach\n\n\nunrender\n\n\nteardown\n\n\ndestruct\n\n\n\n\nLifecycle event names are reserved. They should not be used as names of other events.\n\n\nDOM events\n\n\nDOM events are events that are published by the DOM.\n\n\nbutton on-click=\n...\n\n\n\n\n\nCustom events\n\n\nCustom events are events that are published by event plugins.\n\n\nimg on-tap=\n...\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent events\n\n\nComponent events are events that are published by \ncomponents\n.\n\n\nMyModal on-close=\n...\n /\n\n\n\n\n\nHandling\n\n\nEvent API\n\n\nEvents published from the direct use of the event APIs are also handled by directly using the event APIs (i.e. \nractive.on\n, \nractive.once\n). Most of the other handling methods use the event APIs to handle events at some point in their operation.\n\n\ninstance.on('someevent', (context, message) =\n {\n  console.log(message)\n})\n\n\n\n\nLifecycle events\n\n\nLifecycle events are handled by assigning a function to the appropriate lifecycle event initialization option.\n\n\nRactive({\n  onrender () {\n    console.log('instance has been rendered')\n  }\n})\n\n\n\n\nThe event APIs can also subscribe to lifecycle events. However, the handler must subscribe prior to the event publishing. Using the lifecycle event initialization options is the safer option to ensure the correct timing of subscriptions.\n\n\nProxy syntax\n\n\nRactive instances do not immediately subscribe to template-based events (DOM events, component events, custom events). The proxy syntax \"proxies\" template-based events into events that the current instance can subscribe to. From there, the events are handled by event APIs. Arguments are not supported in this syntax.\n\n\nRactive({\n  template: `\n    \nbutton on-click=\nbuttonclicked\nClick Me!\n/button\n\n  `,\n  on: {\n    buttonclicked (context) {\n      console.log('button clicked')\n    }\n  }\n})\n\n\n\n\nExpression syntax\n\n\nA more powerful form of template-based event handling is the expression syntax, which allows the use of expressions as their values. This form acts very similar to inline scripts plus some useful additions. The expression syntax also has full, unmustached access to data and special references.\n\n\nThe first form is a special form of the proxy syntax. It accepts an array whose first item is the event name, and the rest are its arguments.\n\n\nRactive({\n  template: `\n    \nbutton on-click=\n['buttonclicked', 'foo', 'bar']\nClick Me!\n/button\n\n  `,\n  on: {\n    buttonclicked (context, foo, bar) {\n      console.log('button clicked passing', foo, bar)\n    }\n  }\n})\n\n\n\n\nThe second form uses expressions directly. This allows unrestricted access to almost anything, from calling instance methods, custom methods, or even firing a proxy event manually.\n\n\nRactive({\n  data: { msg: '' },\n  template: `\n    \nbutton on-click=\n@this.set('msg', 'Hello, World!')\nSet message\n/button\n\n    \nbutton on-click=\n@this.greetz(msg)\nPrint message\n/button\n\n    \nbutton on-click=\n@this.fire('manualproxy', msg)\nPrint message via proxy\n/button\n\n    \nbutton on-click=\n@this.set('foo', 1), @this.set('bar', 2)\nCccombo!!!\n/button\n\n  `,\n  greetz(message) {\n    console.log(`${message}`)\n  },\n  on: {\n    manualproxy (context, message) {\n      console.log(`${message}`)\n    }\n  }\n})\n\n\n\n\nEvent context\n\n\nEvent handlers, regardless of event source, receive an \ncontext\n object as first argument. The \ncontext\n object is a special instance of a context object augmented with additional event-related properties where applicable.\n\n\n\n\nname\n - The name of the published event.\n\n\nnode\n - A reference to the DOM node publishing the event. Only available on DOM events.\n\n\nevent\n - A reference to the DOM event. Only available on DOM\n\n\noriginal\n - A reference to the DOM event. Only available on DOM\n\n\ncomponent\n - A reference to the component that published the event. Only available on propagated events.\n\n\n\n\nRactive({\n  template: `\n    \nbutton on-click=\nbuttonclicked\nClick Me!\n/button\n\n  `,\n  on: {\n    buttonclicked (context) {\n      console.log(event.node.type) // submit\n    }\n  }\n})\n\n\n\n\nNamespacing\n\n\nPattern-matching is supported on any type of event, allowing a form of event namespacing. This is done by using a keypath-like event name and using wildcards (\n*\n) on segments during subscription.\n\n\nRactive({\n  el: 'body',\n  append: true,\n  template: `\n    \nbutton on-click=\nfoo.bar\nClick Me!\n/button\n\n    \nbutton on-click=\nfoo.baz\nClick Me!\n/button\n\n    \nbutton on-click=\nfoo.bam\nClick Me!\n/button\n\n    \nbutton on-click=\nqux.bar\nClick Me!\n/button\n\n    \nbutton on-click=\nqux.baz\nClick Me!\n/button\n\n    \nbutton on-click=\nqux.bam\nClick Me!\n/button\n\n  `,\n  on: {\n    '*.bar' (context) {\n      console.log('A bar event was published')\n    },\n    'qux.*' (context) {\n      console.log('A qux event was published')\n    }\n  }\n})\n\n\n\n\nBe aware that handlers subscribing to just \n*\n will fire for \nall\n events.\n\n\nPropagation\n\n\nDOM event propagation\n\n\nNative DOM event propagation is preserved, allowing things such as delegation.\n\n\nRactive({\n  template: `\n    \ndiv on-click=\nbuttonclicked\n\n      \nbutton type=\nbutton\nClick Me!\n/button\n\n    \n/div\n\n  `,\n  on: {\n    buttonclicked (context) {\n      console.log('button clicked')\n    }\n  }\n})\n\n\n\n\nComponent propagation\n\n\nPropagation across component boundaries is also supported. Propagating events are namespaced using the publishing component's name as prefix. This applies to component, proxy, and even lifecycle events.\n\n\nconst ChildComponent = Ractive.extend({\n  template: '\ndiv\n/div\n',\n  oncomplete () {\n    this.fire('childevent')\n  }\n})\n\nconst ParentComponent = Ractive.extend({\n  components: { ChildComponent },\n  template: '\nChildComponent /\n'\n})\n\nconst instance = Ractive({\n  components: { ParentComponent },\n  template: '\nParentComponent /\n'\n})\n\ninstance.on('ChildComponent.childevent', function () {\n  console.log('Hello World!')\n})\n\n\n\n\nStopping propagation\n\n\nPropagation can be stopped by simply returning \nfalse\n from an event handler. If the event is a DOM event, \nevent.stopPropagation()\n and \nevent.preventDefault()\n are automatically called.\n\n\nRactive({\n  template: `\n    \ndiv on-click=\nancestorbuttonclick\n\n      \nbutton on-click=\ndescendantbuttonclick\nClick Me!\n/button\n\n    \n/div\n\n  `,\n  on: {\n    ancestorbuttonclick (context) {\n      console.log('This will not run')\n    },\n    descendantbuttonclick (context) {\n      console.log('This will run')\n      return false\n    }\n  }\n})\n\n\n\n\nReturning \nfalse\n also stops propagation across components.\n\n\nconst ChildComponent = Ractive.extend({\n  template: '\ndiv\n/div\n',\n  oncomplete () {\n    this.fire('childevent')\n  }\n})\n\nconst ParentComponent = Ractive.extend({\n  components: { ChildComponent },\n  template: '\nChildComponent /\n',\n  on: {\n    'ChildComponent.childevent' () {\n      return false\n    }\n  }\n})\n\nconst instance = Ractive({\n  components: { ParentComponent },\n  template: '\nParentComponent /\n'\n})\n\ninstance.on('ChildComponent.childevent', function () {\n  console.log('This will not run')\n})\n\n\n\n\nAssigning a handler using \non-*\n will also stop propagation. However, if \non-*\n is assigned a proxy event and not stopped, that proxy event will propagate in place of the stopped event.\n\n\nconst ChildComponent = Ractive.extend({\n  template: '\ndiv\n/div\n',\n  oncomplete () {\n    this.fire('childevent1')\n    this.fire('childevent2')\n    this.fire('childevent3')\n    this.fire('childevent4')\n  }\n})\n\nconst ParentComponent = Ractive.extend({\n  components: { ChildComponent },\n  template: `\n    \nChildComponent\n      on-childevent1=\n\n      on-childevent2=\nchildevent2proxy\n\n      on-childevent3=\nchildevent3proxy\n\n      on-childevent4=\n@this.parentMethod()\n\n    /\n\n  `,\n  on: {\n    childevent2proxy () {\n      // childevent2proxy replaces childevent2\n    },\n    childevent3proxy () {\n      // childevent3proxy replaces childevent3 but stopped\n      return false\n    }\n  },\n  parentMethod () {\n    // childevent4 handled by a method\n  }\n})\n\nconst instance = Ractive({\n  components: { ParentComponent },\n  template: '\nParentComponent /\n'\n})\n\ninstance.on('ChildComponent.childevent1', function () {\n  console.log('childevent1 stopped by a blank handler')\n})\n\ninstance.on('ChildComponent.childevent2', function () {\n  console.log('childevent2 stopped by a proxy event')\n})\n\ninstance.on('ChildComponent.childevent3', function () {\n  console.log('childevent3 stopped by a proxy event')\n})\n\ninstance.on('ChildComponent.childevent4', function () {\n  console.log('childevent4 stopped by a method call')\n})\n\ninstance.on('ParentComponent.childevent3proxy', function () {\n  console.log('childevent3proxy stopped by returning false')\n})\n\n// This one gets through since its proxy event was left to propagate\ninstance.on('ParentComponent.childevent2proxy', function () {\n  console.log('childevent2proxy fired')\n})\n\n\n\n\nRendering\n\n\nSynchronous rendering\n\n\nRactive does not batch renders, asynchronously render, nor render at next tick. The instance's DOM is updated immediately after its dependencies update. This is a trade-off between optimization and predictability. Ractive chose the latter route to make it easier to anticipate the state of the DOM at any given moment.\n\n\n\n\n\nconst instance = Ractive({\n  target: 'body',\n  data: {\n    count: 0,\n  },\n  template: `\n    \ndiv\n{{ count }}\n/div\n\n  `,\n})\n\nconst div = instance.find('div')\n\nconsole.log('Before:', div.innerHTML)\ninstance.set('count', 100)\nconsole.log('After:', div.innerHTML)\n\n// Before: 0\n// After: 100\n\n\n\n\nThe only time rendering happens asynchronously is during animations and transitions. All mutator methods return a promise which resolves when the animations and/or transitions resulting from these operations complete.\n\n\n\n\n\nconst instance = Ractive({\n  target: 'body',\n  data: {\n    count: 0,\n  },\n  template: `\n    \ndiv\n{{ count }}\n/div\n\n  `,\n})\n\nconst div = instance.find('div')\n\nconsole.log('Before:', div.innerHTML)\ninstance.animate('count', 100).then(() =\n {\n  console.log('Resolved:', div.innerHTML)\n})\nconsole.log('After:', div.innerHTML)\n\n// Before: 0\n// After: 0\n//\n// Resolved: 100\n\n\n\n\nScoped CSS\n\n\nCSS provided via the \ncss\n initialization option is scoped to the component.\n\n\nconst Component = Ractive.extend({\n  template: `\n    \nspan\nI'm red\n/span\n\n    \ndiv\n\n      \nspan\nI'm also red\n/span\n\n    \n/div\n\n  `,\n  css: `\n    span { color: red }\n  `\n})\n\nRactive({\n  components: { Component },\n  el: 'body',\n  template: `\n    \nComponent /\n\n    \nspan\nI'm not red\n/span\n\n  `\n})\n\n\n\n\nThis is done by generating a unique id for each component definition. That ID is then added to each selector defined in \ncss\n and to each top-level element in the component's DOM.\n\n\nspan[data-ractive-css~=\n{6f9bd745-a6b9-9346-0c8c-e3cc94b3d2a5}\n],\n[data-ractive-css~=\n{6f9bd745-a6b9-9346-0c8c-e3cc94b3d2a5}\n] span {\n  color: red\n}\n\n\n\n\nspan data-ractive-css=\n{6f9bd745-a6b9-9346-0c8c-e3cc94b3d2a5}\nI'm red\n/span\n\n\ndiv data-ractive-css=\n{6f9bd745-a6b9-9346-0c8c-e3cc94b3d2a5}\n\n  \nspan\nI'm also red\n/span\n\n\n/div\n\n\nspan\nI'm not red\n/span\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrently, there are a few limitations to this feature:\n\n\n\n\nID-based scoping is not true component scoping and will affect elements of descendant components.\n\n\ncss\n can only be used with components and not on direct Ractive instances. This may change in the future.\n\n\n\n\nProgressive Enhancement\n\n\nTODO\n\n\nServer-side\n\n\nServer-side rendering can be achieved using \nractive.toHTML()\n and \nractive.toCSS()\n. Both methods render the instance and its descendants at their current state to HTML and CSS, respectively.\n\n\nconst Component1 = Ractive.extend({\n  data: {\n    message: ''\n  },\n  template: `\n    \ndiv class=\ncomponent1\n{{message}}\n/div\n\n  `,\n  css: `\n    .component1 { color: red }\n  `\n})\n\nconst Component2 = Ractive.extend({\n  data: {\n    greeting: ''\n  },\n  template: `\n    \ndiv class=\ncomponent2\n{{greeting}}\n/div\n\n  `,\n  css: `\n    .component2 { color: green }\n  `\n})\n\nconst App = Ractive.extend({\n  components: {\n    Component1,\n    Component2\n  },\n  data: {\n    greet: '',\n    msg: ''\n  },\n  template: `\n    \nComponent1 message=\n{{ msg }}\n /\n\n    \nComponent2 greeting=\n{{ greet }}\n /\n\n  `\n})\n\nconst state = { greet: 'Good Morning!', msg: 'Hello, World!' }\nconst app = App({ data: state })\nconst html = app.toHTML()\nconst css = app.toCSS()\n\n\n\n\nCurrently, there are a few limitations to this feature:\n\n\n\n\nractive.toHTML()\n prints HTML without component IDs while \nractive.toCSS()\n prints out selectors with component IDs, which causes the HTML and CSS to not match up.\n\n\nA workaround is to render the CSS as is by setting \nnoCssTransform\n to \ntrue\n and to use a CSS naming convention (i.e BEM, OOCSS, SMACSS) to match up selectors with their elements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nractive.toHTML()\n does not automatically insert the document CSS when rendering a component that represents a full document. This must be done manually.\n\n\n\n\nSecurity\n\n\nUse of the Function constructor\n\n\nRactive uses the \nFunction\n constructor only to convert expressions (i.e. mustache expressions, expression-style computed properties) into value-generating functions. As of 0.9, \nallowExpressions\n initialization option is available to toggle the expression-to-function feature. Setting it to \nfalse\n will tell Ractive neither to parse nor process expressions.\n\n\nContent Security Policy\n\n\nOut of the box, Ractive will violate certain CSP directives due to the use of the \nFunction\n constructor for evaluating expressions, and dynamically generated \nstyle\n elements for Ractive-managed CSS.\n\n\nIn order to avoid violating \nscript-src\n, either:\n\n\n\n\nPre-parse templates. As of 0.8, the parser will store expressions as functions on the AST. To preserve the functions when serializing the AST, use libraries like \nnode-tosource\n or \nserialize-javascript\n instead of \nJSON.stringify()\n.\n\n\nSet \nallowExpressions\n initialization option to \nfalse\n. This will tell Ractive to avoid evaluating expressions.\n\n\nAdd the \nscript-src 'unsafe-eval'\n CSP directive. This will allow the use of the \nFunction\n constructor.\n\n\n\n\nIn order to avoid violating \nstyle-src\n, either:\n\n\n\n\nAdd \nstyle-src 'unsafe-inline'\n to your CSP directives. This will allow the use of dynamically generated \nstyle\n elements.\n\n\n\n\nTemplates\n\n\nStrictly speaking, Ractive templates are not HTML. They are markup representations of objects that are used to construct HTML. Simply put, templates are \nHTML-like\n. Ractive parses templates into \nAST\ns which contain everything Ractive needs to know to construct an instance's DOM, data bindings, events and transitions etc.\n\n\nRactive.parse('\ndiv class=\nmessage\nHello World!\n/div\n')\n\n// {\nv\n:4,\nt\n:[{\nt\n:7,\ne\n:\ndiv\n,\nm\n:[{\nn\n:\nclass\n,\nf\n:\nmessage\n,\nt\n:13}],\nf\n:[\nHello World!\n]}]}\n\n\n\n\nKeypaths\n\n\nA keypath is a kind of reference that represents the location of a piece of data.\n\n\nRactive({\n  data: {\n    foo: {\n      bar: {\n        baz: {\n          qux: 'Hello, World!'\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  template: `\n    {{ foo.bar.baz.qux }}\n  `\n})\n\n\n\n\nDot and bracket notations\n\n\nDot and bracket notation rules for keypaths are similar to vanilla JS. The only addition to this is that the dot notation can also be used to access arrays, by using the index directly on the segment.\n\n\nconst instance = Ractive({\n  data: {\n    items: [1, 2, 3],\n    foo: {\n      bar: {\n        baz: {\n          qux: 'Hello, World!',\n          'dotted.key': 'Me, Hungry!'\n        }\n      }\n    },\n    dynamicKey: 'bar'\n  },\n  template: `\n    {{ foo['bar']['baz']['qux'] }} \n!-- bracket notation object access --\n\n    {{ foo.bar.baz.qux }}          \n!-- dot notation object access --\n\n\n    {{ items[0] }} \n!-- bracket notation array access --\n\n    {{ items.0 }}  \n!-- dot notation array access --\n\n\n    {{ foo.bar.baz['dotted.key'] }} \n!-- dotted key access --\n\n\n    {{ foo[dynamicKey].baz.qux }} \n!-- dynamic key access --\n\n  `\n})\n\n\n\n\nMissing properties\n\n\nIn JavaScript, trying to access a child property of an object that does not exist would throw an error. In Ractive, it would simply return \nundefined\n or render nothing.\n\n\nconst instance = Ractive({\n  data: {\n    numbers: [ 1, 2, 3 ]\n  },\n  template: `\n    {{ letters[0] }}\n  `\n})\n\nractive.get( 'letters[0]' ) // undefined\n\n\n\n\nUpstream and downstream keypaths\n\n\nRactive has this concept of \"upstream\" and \"downstream\" keypaths. Upstream keypaths are ancestor keypaths. For the keypath \nfoo.bar.baz.qux\n, it's upstream keypaths are \nfoo\n, \nfoo.bar\n and \nfoo.bar.baz\n. Downstream keypaths are descendant keypaths. For the \nfoo\n keypath, it's downstream keypaths would be \nfoo.bar\n, \nfoo.bar.baz\n and \nfoo.bar.baz.qux\n.\n\n\nReferences\n\n\nA reference is a string that refers to a piece of data. A keypath is an example of a reference, one that points to a specific location in the data. Special references are also a form of reference, one that provides to a certain value.\n\n\nReference resolution\n\n\nRactive follows the following resolution algorithm to find the value of a reference:\n\n\n\n\nIf the reference a special reference, resolve with that keypath.\n\n\nIf the reference is explicit or matches a path in the current context exactly, resolve with that keypath.\n\n\nGrab the current virtual node from the template hierarchy.\n\n\nIf the reference matches an alias, section indexes, or keys, resolve with that keypath.\n\n\nIf the reference matches any mappings, resolve with that keypath.\n\n\nIf the reference matches a path on the context, resolve with that keypath.\n\n\nRemove the innermost context from the stack. Repeat steps 3-7.\n\n\nIf the reference is a valid keypath by itself, resolve with that keypath.\n\n\nIf the reference is still unresolved, add it to the 'pending resolution' pile. Each time potentially matching keypaths are updated, resolution will be attempted for the unresolved reference.\n\n\n\n\nContext stack\n\n\nWhenever Ractive encounters section mustaches or similar constructs, it stores the context in a \ncontext stack\n. Ractive then resolves references relative to the top of the stack, and popping off contexts until the reference resolves to a keypath.\n\n\nRactive({\n  data: {\n    qux: 'Me, Hungry!',\n    foo: {\n      bar: {\n        baz: 'Hello, World!'\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  template: `\n                \n!-- context is the root of the data --\n\n    {{#foo}}    \n!-- context is now foo --\n\n      {{#bar}}  \n!-- context is now foo.bar --\n\n        {{baz}} \n!-- Resolution order: foo.bar.baz, foo.baz, baz. Resolved at foo.bar.baz. --\n\n        {{qux}} \n!-- Resolution order: foo.bar.quz, foo.qux, qux. Resolved at qux. --\n\n      {{/}}\n    {{/}}\n  `,\n})\n\n\n\n\nConditional attributes\n\n\nSections can toggle attributes, whether it's one attribute, multiple attributes or specific values of the attribute.\n\n\n!-- one attribute --\n\n\na href=\n/\n {{#if currentPage}}class=\nactive\n{{/if}}\nHome\n/a\n\n\n\n!-- multiple attributes --\n\n\na href=\n/\n {{#if currentPage}}class=\nactive\n title=\nCurrent page\n{{/if}}\nHome\n/a\n\n\n\n!-- specific attribute value --\n\n\na href=\n/\n class=\nnav-link {{#if currentPage}}nav-link--active{{/if}}\nHome\n/a\n\n\n\n\n\nOptimization\n\n\nPre-parsing\n\n\nParsing templates can be a very slow operation. As an optimization option, templates can be pre-parsed outside of runtime, speeding up app initialization. Most loaders do pre-parsing of templates as part of their build process. A parsed template is approximately 30-40% larger than the markup version, making it a trade-off between space and processing.\n\n\nLimiting template expressions\n\n\nWhile expressions provide power and convenience when building templates, it incurs a performance penalty as Ractive sets up each one on a per-instance level. To avoid this overhead, there are several places where logic can move to, trimming down expressions into mere function calls.\n\n\nFunctions can be set on the data globally via \nRactive.defaults.data\n.\n\n\nRactive.defaults.data.customLogic = function () { ... }\n\nRactive({\n  template: `\n    {{ customLogic() }}\n  `\n})\n\n\n\n\nFunctions can also be defined on a component level using methods.\n\n\nconst Component = Ractive.extend({\n  template: `\n    {{ @this.customLogic() }}\n  `,\n  customLogic () {\n    ...\n  }\n})\n\n\n\n\nExpression processing\n\n\nWhen Ractive parses a template, it creates a string representation of the expression structure and keeps track of its dependencies. Then Ractive converts these expression strings into a function which can be called to generate the expression's value.\n\n\nRactive optimizes this routine starting by generating the same expression string for structurally-identical expressions. Then a value-generating function is created for each \ndistinct\n expression string, cached globally and shared to all instances. Furthermore, Ractive caches the generated values and only updates them when the expression's dependencies update.\n\n\n// Expression parsing\nRactive.parse('{{ a + b }}{{ c + d }}')\n\n// {\n//   \nv\n: 4,\n//   \nt\n: [\n//     {\n//       \nt\n: 2,\n//       \nx\n: {\n//         \nr\n: [\na\n,\nb\n], \n-- dependencies here\n//         \ns\n: \n_0+_1\n    \n-- expression string here\n//       }\n//     },\n//     {\n//       \nt\n: 2,\n//       \nx\n: {\n//         \nr\n: [\nc\n,\nd\n], \n-- dependencies here\n//         \ns\n: \n_0+_1\n    \n-- expression string here\n//       }\n//     }\n//   ],\n//   \ne\n: {}\n// }\n\n// Building and caching of the expression resolver of `_0+_1`\nconst expressionFunctionsCache = {}\nexpressionFunctionsCache['_0+_1'] = new Function('_0', '_1', 'return _0+_1')\n\n// Evaluate {{ a + b }}\nconst dep = ['a', 'b']\nconst exp = '_0+_1'\nconst arg = dep.map(instance.get)\nconst val = expressionFunctionsCache[exp].apply(instance, arg)\n\n// Evaluate {{ c + d }}\nconst dep = ['c', 'd']\nconst exp = '_0+_1'\nconst arg = dep.map(instance.get)\nconst val = expressionFunctionsCache[exp].apply(instance, arg)\n\n\n\n\nThe \nFunction\n constructor was chosen over \neval\n because it allows Ractive to compile the expression string \nonce\n as well as \ncache\n the resulting function, instead of evaluating the string every time the value is needed.",

Each item expressable in Ractive-flavored mustache has its own parsing function that may also be comprised of other parsing functions.

Each key along the keypath has its own corresponding model.  Models allow entities that depend upon them to register themeselves to receive change notifications when the model value changes. This is how Ractive keeps track of exactly which parts of the view need to be updated when values change.  All of the data managed by Ractive is represented by its model hierarchy.  Almost every type of Model is a subclass of  Model , so it seems a good place to start. Each model typically has a parent model, a key that is used to access its value from its parent, and a value. Most models also have children of some sort, which are tracked by key such that  { foo: { bar: 'baz' } }  would have a model with a  childByKey['foo'] , which would also have a model at  childByKey['bar'] . The value of each of the models listed there would be the object containing  foo: { bar: baz } , its  foo  child would be the object  bar: 'baz' , and its  bar  child would be the string  'baz' . Where children of a model are other models, dependents ( deps ) of a model may be anything that wants to be notified of changes, and each model will typically have a number of dependents, too.  Each model has a unique keypath that is assembled by taking its key and each of its parents keys up to the root and joining them with a  . .

Next, any dependents of the model will be notified that the model has had a value change as their  handleChange  methods are called. Finally, upstream models (parents) are notified that a change has taken place somewhere among its children.  The child notification of the propagation is handled by the model's  mark  method.  mark  also checks to see that the value has actually changed, and if it has, will notify its children and dependents that it has had a value change.

This is achieved by having the special array method handlers compute which indexes are actually changed and having the array model's deps that can actally handle a shuffle ignore any untouched indices.  The instance method  merge  does something similar, but instead of modifying the underlying array, it compares the members of the new supplied array against the model array to compute the index changes.

Creation is basically just the constructor call and almost always is immediately followed by binding. Binding is the point at which the item resolves and registers with its data references. Rendering is the point at which the item inserts an actual DOM node into the DOM. Bubbling and updating are the two halves of the update process, which is discussed in the next section.

EventDirective s - when rendered attach an event listener to their parent, and when unrenedered, remove it. Event parameters are kept in sync with their bindings and are evaluated when the event fires.  BindingDirective s - when rendered and unrendered update their parent element's bindings, if they exist.  Decorator s - when rendered call the named decorator with their parent element, and when unrenedered, remove it.  Decorator s also have an update cycle related to their parameters.  Transition s - are a sort of weird case.

If you'd like to find out more about new features, you can check out the \nchangelog\n.\n\n\nMigrating from 0.9\n\n\nDefaults\n\n\nresolveInstanceMembers\n now defaults to \nfalse\n to avoid foot maimings associated with common instance member names and ambiguous references.\n\n\nComputations\n\n\nThe stringy syntax for computed properties has changed to plain old expression syntax. This means that \n${length} * ${width}\n as a computation is now just \nlength * width\n, which is hopefully a little less surprising given \n${interpolator}\n syntax in template strings.\n\n\n'.'s in computation keypaths must now be escaped if they're meant to be part of a single key, as you can now add computations below the root level.\n\n\nTemplate format\n\n\nTemplate positions in parsed template AST are now stored in the \nq\n member rather than the \np\n member to avoid accidental overlap with local partials.\n\n\nData\n\n\nChecking that a value exists at some keypath in the data will no longer exclude the root prototypes (\nObject\n, \nFunction\n, \nArray\n) because doing so creates issues when dealing with \nObject.create(null)\n. If you keep your references unambiguous, this shouldn't cause any issues. The simplest example of where this can cause trouble is with \n{ items: [{ length: 10 }, {}] }\n in \n{{#each items}}{{length}}{{/each}}\n where the second length will be that of the items array because the object has no length property but its parent context, the array, does.\n\n\nAliases now take precedent over properties from contexts above their alias defintions. This means that \n{{#with { foo: 10 } }}{{#with 42 as foo}}{{foo}}{{/with}}{{/with}}\n results in \n42\n rather than \n10\n, which is hopefully the less surprising behavior.\n\n\nThe context pop reference prefix \n^^/\n now correctly handles \n{{#each}}\n blocks such that \n^^/ === ../../\n from immediately within the block body. This is because \n^^/\n is supposed to jump explicit contexts and not just implicit contexts as provided by each iteration.\n\n\nPolyfills\n\n\npolyfills.js\n is no longer included in the build, as it was just an empty placeholder since the handful of polyfills that were in it were included in the main build.\n\n\nMigrating from 0.8\n\n\nRemoved deprecations\n\n\n0.9 removes any of the remaining deprecations from 0.8, including:\n\n\n\n\ndecorator=\"name:{{arg1}},{{arg2}}\n directives, to be replaced with \nas-name=\"arg1, arg2\"\n\n\nintro=\"name:{{ { arg1: arg1, arg2, arg2 } }}\"\n and the same forms of \noutro\n and \nintro-outro\n to be replaced with \nname-in=\"{ arg1, arg2 }\"\n and the same forms of \nname-out\n and \nname-in-out\n\n\nThe \nractive.data\n getter, to be replaced with \nractive.get()\n, which returns a computed object tree containing virtual keys like mappings, links, and computations. The optional form \nractive.get({ virtual: false })\n will return the raw root object without any virtual keys.\n\n\nLifecycle methods \ninit\n and \nbeforeInit\n, to be replaced with lifecycle events or equivalent instance methods. \nbeforeInit\n corresponds to the \nconstruct\n lifecycle event.\n\n\nPartial comments in the form of \n!-- {{\nmyPartial}} --\n...\n!-- {{/myPartial}} --\n, to be replaced with partial blocks \n{{#partial myPartial}}...{{/partial}}\n\n\n\n\nPart of removing directive deprecations allowed using the plain expression parser for attributes and directives, which means that directives that parse in an expression context are much more resilient to things like quote pileup with strings e.g. \nas-target=\"\"id as a string\"\"\n.\n\n\nNote\n: this also means that directive values aren't processed as HTML before being parsed, so HTML entities are no longer automatically encoded within directive values.\n\n\nTemplate format\n\n\nThe template format produced by \nRactive.parse\n has changed, making it incompatible with previous versions of Ractive.js and their template formats. You will need to re-parse any pre-parsed templates for use with 0.9.\n\n\nEvent delegation\n\n\nRactive will now automatically set up event delegation for elements that contain iterative sections. This installs a single DOM listener on the host element for each event type within the iterative section, and when an event fires from one of the iterative elements with a listener, the parent delegation target handles triggering listeners on the correct elements. This prevents having to set up large numbers of event listeners in iterative sections, but it can also surface inconsistencies in browser event implementations. If you need to disable event delegation for a special case, you can add a \nno-delegation\n attribute to the element containing the iterative section, pass \ndelegate: false\n to your component or instance, or set \nRactive.defaults.delegate\n to \nfalse\n.\n\n\nPartial context\n\n\nAny context provided to a partial \n{{\nmy-partial context}}\n is no longer wrapped around the partial but is instead wrapped around the \ncontent\n of the partial. It's a subtle difference that only shows up when the partial name is an expression e.g. \n{{\n.type ~/external.item}}\n. Before this break, the \n.type\n would resolve to \n~/external.item.type\n, and now it will resolve to \n.type\n on the context in which the partial appears.\n\n\nYielding\n\n\nYielding is no longer restricted to inline partials, and each partial may be yielded more than once. You will no longer get a warning if you try to yield an instance or dynamic partial or if you yield the same partial multiple times.\n\n\nnoIntro\n inheritance\n\n\nThe \nnoIntro\n setting of an instance that contains components will now apply to the components too, unless those components have their own \nnoIntro\n setting.\n\n\nPolyfills\n\n\nThere is no longer a \nlegacy\n build of Ractive.js available. Instead, a separate \npolyfills\n library is available that can be included before Ractive.js is loaded, or you can supply your own polyfills, shims, or shams.\n\n\nNode registry\n\n\nElements with an \nid\n attribute are no longer collected into a \nnodes\n map on the Ractive.js instance. If you require similar functionality, it can be achieved in a much more flexible way with a decorator.\n\n\nUnresolved references\n\n\nReferences that don't resolve are no longer kept in an unresolved state, waiting on an appropriate keypath to pop into existence somewhere in the context hierarchy. Instead, references that don't resolve are immediately resolved in the current context, which tends to be the desired behavior in most circumstances.\n\n\nLive queries\n\n\nElement and component queries no longer support automatically keeping the resulting array up to date as new matching elements or components are rendered. If you require similar functionality, it can be achieved with a decorator for elements or bubbled lifecycle events for components.\n\n\nchange\n event\n\n\nThe \nchange\n event has been removed and replaced by recursive observers, which are strictly opt-in and can be scoped to a deeper keypath than the root.\n\n\nevent\n reference\n\n\nThe \nevent\n special reference available to event directives has been deprecated and replaced with three special references:\n\n\n\n\n@context\n, which is roughly equivalent to \nevent\n, but with both an \nevent\n and \noriginal\n key that point to the original event object. This is a context object.\n\n\n@event\n, which is resolves to the original event that triggered the directive.\n\n\n@node\n, which resolves to the element to which the event directive is attached.\n\n\n\n\nInstance events\n\n\nThe signature for callbacks to instance events, supplied to \nractive.on()\n, now \nalways\n includes a context regardless of the origin of the event (DOM or API). Additionally, the \nfire\n method has changed such that the first argument may be a context object. Any events that need to send an object to the callback as the first post-context argument will need to supply a placeholder context object e.g. \nractive.fire( 'event', { first: 'arg' } )\n becomes \nractive.fire( 'event', {}, { first: 'arg' } )\n.\n\n\nractive.merge\n\n\nractive.merge\n has been removed and replaced by an option on \nractive.set\n, \n{ shuffle: true }\n, which more accurately reflects what actually happens. \nmerge\n did not merge data, but instead re-arranged any DOM associated with the elements in the given array to match the order of the array - hence \nshuffle\n rather than \nmerge\n.\n\n\nIsolation\n\n\nComponents are now \nisolated\n by default. If you need non-\nisolated\n components in order to create implicit mappings as data is accessed, you can pass \nisolated: false\n to \nextend\n when creating the component. If you prefer all components to be non-\nisolated\n by default, you can set \nRactive.defaults.isolated = false\n.\n\n\nFurther, non-\nisolated\n components will now create implicit mappings when necessary for \nset\n operations, including \nadd\n, \nsubtract\n, etc, in addition to \nget\n operations. To avoid creating an implicit mapping with a \nset\n operation from a non-\nisolated\n component, pass \n{ isolated: true }\n as an option to the \nset\n method.\n\n\nMagic and array adaptors\n\n\nThe magic and array adaptors are no longer part of Ractive.js core. They may be reappear as independent plugins at some point in the future.\n\n\nclass-\n directives\n\n\nclass-\n directives are now parsed in an expression context like decorator, transition, and event directives, rather than in a string context like attributes and \nstyle-\n directives. This means that mustaches are no longer required for \nclass-\n directive values, so you should use \nclass-selected=\".selected\"\n rather than \nclass-selected=\"{{.selected}}\"\n.\n\n\ngetNodeInfo\n\n\nractive.getNodeInfo\n has been renamed to \nractive.getContext\n, as has the static version of the function, to more accurately reflect its function. The \ngetNodeInfo\n alias is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.\n\n\nMultiple inheritance\n\n\nComponents can no longer inherit from multiple other components at the same level, meaning that \nRactive.extend(FirstComponent, SecondComponent)\n is no longer possible. You can still set up an inheritance hierachy multiple levels deep with \nconst First = Ractive.extend({ ...options }); const Second = First.extend({ ...others });\n.\n\n\nMigrating from 0.7\n\n\nTemplate format\n\n\nThe template format produced by \nRactive.parse\n has changed, making it incompatible with previous versions of Ractive.js and their template formats. You will need to re-parse any pre-parsed templates for use with 0.8.\n\n\nIE8\n\n\nIE8 is no longer supported. If you still need to support IE8, well, we're very, very sorry...\n\n\nExpressions and binding\n\n\nTwo-way bindings are no longer supported in computed contexts that don't have a \nset\nter, including template expression contexts. This means that \n{{#each filter(list)}}\ninput value=\"{{.name}}\" /\n{{/each}}\n is no longer possible. The reasoning behind this change is that the original \nlist.${index}.name\n is not updated when the binding within the computed context in the \neach\n expression is changed. 0.9 adds an instance flag \nsyncComputedChildren\n that can address this.\n\n\nRelaxed partial names\n\n\nPartial names can now include \n\\\n characters, which can be problematic if you happen to use division with no spaces arount the \n/\n in a partial expression.\n\n\nInteger references\n\n\nIntegers are no longer considered references, even in an array context, meaning that in \n{{#with [1, 2, 3]}}{{0}}{{/with}}\n will no longer result in \n1\n being rendered. Integers are now stricly considered to integer literals. If you need to reference a specific index in an array context, you can do so with a context specific reference like \n{{this.0}}\n.\n\n\nArray modification\n\n\nmodifyArrays\n now defaults to \nfalse\n, so the array adaptor is not applied to arrays automatically as they are added to the instance data. The preferred method of performing array operations is using the \nsplice\n, \npush\n, \npop\n, etc methods on the Ractive.js instance.\n\n\nMigrating from 0.6\n\n\nWhat's new\n\n\nComponents can now access their parents and containers using an official API.\n\n\nBinding directives may be set on elements that support two-way binding. These directives override the settings on the Ractive instance for \ntwoway\n and \nlazy\n.\n\n\nSingle-fire versions of \nractive.on\n and \nractive.observe\n are now available as \nractive.once\n and \nractive.observeOnce\n.\n\n\nInline partials can now be defined within a new section \n{{#partial partial-name}}...{{/partial}}\n. The old comment syntax is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release.\n\n\nInline partials are now scoped to their nearest element. If a partial reference sits in the template below an element with a matching inline partial, the inline partial will be used in the reference. This can be used as a sort of partial inheritance. If an inline partial is defined directly within a component tag or the root of the template, it will be added to the Ractive instance.\n\n\nComponents may now yield to multiple inline partials by supplying the partial name with yield e.g. \n{{yield some-name}}\n. Yielding without a name will still result in non-partial content being yielded. Only inline partials may be yielded. Any partials, including inline and inherited, may still be referenced within a component using a plain partial section e.g. \n{{\npartial}}\n.\n\n\nPartials can now be reset without resorting to manually un/re-rendering them using a wrapping conditional section. This can be done with the new \nresetPartial\n method on Ractive instances.\n\n\nthis.event\n is now available to method-call event handlers.\n\n\nRegular expression literals can now be used in template expressions.\n\n\nYou can now escape mustaches with a '\\' if you'd like them to appear in the template.\n\n\nractive.toggle\n now works with patterns.\n\n\nThe debug setting is no longer set per-instance. It has been replaced with \nRactive.DEBUG\n, which defaults to true. You can set it automatically based on whether or not the your code has been minified with:\n\n\nRactive.DEBUG = /unminified/.test(function(){/*unminified*/})\n\n\n\n\nBreaking changes and deprecation\n\n\n\n\ntwoway\n and \nlazy\n are now reserved attribute names to be used as binding directives.\n\n\nInline partials now belong to their nearest element.\n\n\nThe comment syntax for inline partials is now deprecated.\n\n\nelseif\n is now a reserved identifier.\n\n\nractive.data\n is no longer available. Use \nractive.get()\n to get a shallow copy of the data with any component mappings.\n\n\nChild data always overrides parent data, whether it is a POJO (Plain Old JS Object) or not.\n\n\nractive.debug\n has been replaced with the global \nRactive.DEBUG\n flag.\n\n\n\n\nMigrating from 0.5\n\n\nLifecycle events\n\n\nRactive instances now emit \nlifecycle events\n. If you use \nRactive.extend(...)\n with \ninit()\n, \nbeforeInit()\n or \ncomplete()\n, you will need to replace them - they will continue to work, but will be removed in a future version.\n\n\ninit()\n can be replaced with one of the following methods, or you may need to split your code into both methods. Use \nonrender()\n for code that needs access to the rendered DOM, but is safe being called more than once if you unrender and rerender your ractive instance. Use \noninit()\n for code that should run only once or needs to be run regardless of whether the ractive instance is rendered into the DOM.\n\n\nThe \ninit()\n method also no longer recieves an \noptions\n parameter as the ractive instance now inherits \nall\n options passed to the constructor. You can still access the options directly using the \nonconstruct()\n method.\n\n\nbeforeInit()\n and \ncomplete()\n can be replaced directly with \nonconstruct()\n and \noncomplete()\n respectively.\n\n\nSee the lifecycle events page for more detail.\n\n\nOther Breaking changes\n\n\n\n\nnew Ractive()\n now inherits all options as methods/properties including event hooks. If you have been passing data through custom initialisation options be aware that they will appended to your ractive instance.\n\n\nUsing other elements besides \nscript\n for templates is an now an error. Migrate any templates in non-script elements and include a non-javascript type so the browser does not try to interpret your template:\n\n\n\n\njs\n    \nscript id='template' type='text/ractive'\n\n      Your template goes here\n    \n/script\n\n\n\n\nNew reserved events cannot be used for proxy event names, i.e. \np on-click='init'\n/p\n. These include 'change', 'config', 'construct', 'init', 'render', 'reset', 'teardown', 'unrender', and 'update'. You will need to rename your events.\n\n\nSetting uninitialised data on a component will no longer cause it to leak out into the parent scope\n\n\n'Smart updates', via \nractive.merge()\n and \nractive.shift()\n etc, work across component boundaries. In most cases this is the expected behavior.\n\n\nThe CSS length interpolator has been removed.\n\n\n\n\nMigrating from 0.4\n\n\nBreaking changes\n\n\n\n\nErrors in observers and evaluators are no longer caught\n\n\nNodes are detached as soon as any outro transitions are complete (if any), rather than when \nall\n transitions are complete\n\n\n(Outdated if you are moving to \n0.6.x\n or above) The options argument of \ninit: function(options)\n is now strictly what was passed into the constructor, use \nthis.option\n to access configured value.\n\n\ndata\n with properties on prototype are no longer cloned when accessed. \ndata\n from \"baseClass\" is no longer deconstructed and copied.\n\n\nOptions specified on component constructors will not be picked up as defaults. \ndebug\n now on \ndefaults\n, not constructor\n\n\nSelect bindings follow general browser rules for choosing options. Disabled options have no value.\n\n\nInput values are not coerced to numbers, unless input type is \nnumber\n or \nrange\n\n\n{{this.foo}}\n in templates now means same thing as \n{{.foo}}\n\n\nRendering to an element already render by Ractive causes that element to be torn down (unless appending).\n\n\nIllegal javascript no longer allowed by parser in expressions and will throw\n\n\nParsed template format changed to specify template spec version.\n\n\nProxy-event representation\n\n\nNon-dynamic (bound) fragments of html are no longer stored as single string\n\n\nSee https://github.com/ractivejs/template-spec for current spec.\n\n\nArrays being observed via \narray.*\n no longer send \nitem.length\n event on mutation changes\n\n\nReserved event names in templates ('change', 'config', 'construct', 'init', 'render', 'reset', 'teardown', 'unrender', 'update') will cause the parser to throw an error\n\n\n{{else}}\n support in both handlebars-style blocks and regular mustache conditional blocks, but is now a restricted keyword that cannot be used as a regular reference\n\n\nChild components are created in data order\n\n\nReference expressions resolve left to right and follow same logic as regular mustache references (bind to root, not context, if left-most part is unresolved).\n\n\nImproved attribute parsing and handling:\n\n\ncharacter escaping and whitespace handling in attribute directive arguments\n\n\nboolean and empty string attributes\n\n\nComputed properties no longer create nested objects with keypath like names, i.e. \npage.area: '${width} * ${height}'\n creates a property accessible by \n{{page.area}}\n but not \n{{#page}}{{area}}{{/page}}\n\n\nThe element into which the ractive instance was rendered is no longer available as \nractive.el\n.

Components may now yield to multiple inline partials by supplying the partial name with yield e.g.  {{yield some-name}} . Yielding without a name will still result in non-partial content being yielded. Only inline partials may be yielded.
